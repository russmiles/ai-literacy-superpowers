# Reflection Log

<!-- Each entry is appended by integration-agent at the end of a pipeline run.
     Entries capture what was surprising, what went wrong, and what should be
     proposed for addition to AGENTS.md.

     Do NOT modify AGENTS.md directly from this log — only propose. Humans
     curate AGENTS.md. The value of this log is that it provides the raw
     material for curation, not that it auto-populates memory.

     Entry format:

     ---

     - **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
     - **Agent**: integration-agent
     - **Task**: [one-sentence summary]
     - **Surprise**: [anything unexpected during the pipeline run]
     - **Proposal**: [pattern or gotcha to consider for AGENTS.md, or "none"]
     - **Improvement**: [what would make the pipeline smoother next time]
     - **Signal**: [context | instruction | workflow | failure | none]
     - **Constraint**: [proposed constraint, or "none"]
     - **Session metadata**:
       - Duration: [estimated session duration, e.g. "45 min" or "unknown"]
       - Model tiers used: [e.g. "capable (30%), standard (70%)" or "unknown"]
       - Pipeline stages completed: [e.g. "5/5" or list of agents, or "unknown"]
       - Agent delegation: [full pipeline | partial | manual | unknown]

     Session metadata fields are best-effort. Use "unknown" for any
     value that cannot be determined. Entries written before 2026-04-14
     predate session metadata — treat missing fields as "unknown".

     Signal types classify where the learning should route:
       context     → HARNESS.md Context section (priming gaps)
       instruction → Skills or shared commands (prompt improvements)
       workflow    → AGENTS.md (process patterns)
       failure     → Constraints via /harness-constrain (preventable errors)
       none        → No routing needed (routine work)

     Entries written before 2026-04-08 predate the Signal field.
     Treat missing Signal fields as "none" when computing metrics.

- **Date**: 2026-04-06
- **Agent**: orchestrator (opus)
- **Task**: Added gitleaks secret detection skill and harness integration, then initialized the project's own harness with 6 constraints and promoted ShellCheck to deterministic
- **Surprise**: ShellCheck found 4 issues in existing scripts including `secrets-check.sh` which had just been created and passed both implementer and spec compliance review — the unused variable (`output`) and sed-vs-parameter-expansion patterns were invisible to the subagent reviewers because the spec review checked structure and behaviour, not shell idioms
- **Proposal**: When adding a new deterministic constraint (like ShellCheck), always run a test pass against the full codebase before promoting — including files created earlier in the same session. Consider adding ShellCheck to the default harness template alongside gitleaks so new projects get it from the start.
- **Improvement**: The spec reviewer subagent should be briefed to run ShellCheck (or equivalent linters) as part of its verification when reviewing shell scripts, rather than only checking structural requirements against the spec. Deterministic tools catch what LLM review misses.

- **Date**: 2026-04-06
- **Agent**: orchestrator (opus)
- **Task**: Initialized the project's own harness (HARNESS.md, CI workflow, badges) and generated the baseline health snapshot
- **Surprise**: 5 out of 6 constraints reached deterministic enforcement on first init — far higher than typical projects. This is because the plugin's "code" is markdown and bash, where lightweight tools (markdownlint, gitleaks, bash -n, grep, shellcheck) cover nearly everything. Projects with application code would start with more unverified or agent-level constraints.
- **Proposal**: Future agents should know that this project's harness is self-referential — the plugin defines the harness framework, and its own HARNESS.md uses that framework. Changes to template files (templates/HARNESS.md) do not automatically propagate to the project's root HARNESS.md. The command-prompt sync GC rule and plugin manifest currency GC rule are particularly important here to catch drift between the plugin's own docs and its shipped templates.
- **Improvement**: The health snapshot was committed directly to main because it's a generated artifact. Consider whether snapshot commits should go through PRs for consistency, or whether direct-to-main is the right pattern for observability artifacts that don't affect behaviour.

- **Date**: 2026-04-07
- **Agent**: orchestrator (opus)
- **Task**: Researched harness engineering patterns on GitHub, designed and implemented three Tier 1 features in parallel: auto-enforcer GitHub Action, convention sync across AI tools, and architectural fitness functions for the GC system
- **Surprise**: Worktree-isolated subagents consistently failed on Bash permissions — the isolation mechanism did not carry tool permissions through to the child agent. Non-worktree background agents worked but cross-contaminated branches (convention-sync commits landed on the fitness-functions branch), requiring manual cherry-picking to untangle. The worktree permission issue is a platform-level problem worth investigating — worktrees are the intended isolation mechanism for parallel agents, but if they can't run git commands, they're useless for implementation work.
- **Proposal**: Future agents should know: (1) worktree isolation for subagents is currently unreliable for implementation tasks that need Bash/git — use regular background agents on separate branches instead, but expect branch cross-contamination when multiple agents share the same repo; (2) when dispatching parallel implementation agents without worktrees, each agent should be given explicit instructions to verify it's on the correct branch before committing, and the orchestrator should plan for cherry-pick cleanup; (3) the three Tier 1 features (auto-enforcer, convention-sync, fitness-functions) each modify `templates/HARNESS.md` — merging them in sequence will cause conflicts on the later PRs, so always rebase the last one after merging the first two.
- **Improvement**: Investigate why worktree-isolated agents lose Bash permissions. This may be a Claude Code plugin permission scoping issue — the `.claude/settings.local.json` allow-list may not propagate to worktree paths. If fixable, worktrees would be the clean solution for parallel implementation. If not, the dispatching-parallel-agents skill should document the "branch cross-contamination" risk and recommend the cherry-pick cleanup pattern as standard practice.

- **Date**: 2026-04-08
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (interactive)
- **Task**: Closed gaps in all three harness feedback loops and updated docs to reflect the improvements (PRs #76–#77)
- **Surprise**: Nothing unexpected — the work went smoothly as planned
- **Proposal**: Future agents should know that the three harness feedback loops (enforcement, observation, garbage collection) are tightly coupled — changing one loop's behaviour or output format can affect the other two. When modifying any single loop, check the interfaces between all three before considering the work complete.
- **Improvement**: none

- **Date**: 2026-04-08
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (interactive + haiku/sonnet subagents)
- **Task**: Integrated Boeckeler's Feedback Flywheel concepts — added signal classification to reflections, vocabulary mapping to docs, and Session Quality metrics to snapshot format (PR #81)
- **Surprise**: Nothing unexpected — the subagent pipeline executed cleanly across 7 tasks with spec compliance review on each
- **Proposal**: Future agents should know: (1) reflection template changes must propagate to all consumers — the /reflect command, the integration agent, REFLECTION_LOG.md header comment, and the self-improving-harness docs page all carry copies of the template; (2) the explanation pages cross-reference each other heavily — changes to one concept page (e.g. compound-learning.md) may require updates to self-improving-harness.md, three-enforcement-loops.md, and others that reference the same structures

- **Date**: 2026-04-09
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (interactive + haiku/sonnet subagents)
- **Task**: Major session — org transfer to Habitat-Thinking, feedback flywheel signal classification, model sovereignty skill, Article 07 (The Assessment Practice), literacy-improvements skill bridging assessment to action, portfolio-assessment skill for multi-repo aggregation, semver workflow convention. Plugin went from v0.1.0 to v0.6.0 across PRs #79–#90.
- **Surprise**: The three-layer assessment stack (assess → literacy-improvements → portfolio-assess) emerged iteratively from conversation rather than being designed upfront. Each layer naturally read the output of the layer below — the improvement mapping reads assessment gaps, the portfolio reads individual assessments and the improvement mapping. The architecture was coherent despite being discovered incrementally.
- **Proposal**: Future agents should know: (1) the assessment system is now three layers deep — single-repo assessment, improvement planning, and portfolio aggregation — and changes to the assessment document format affect all three layers; (2) iterative design conversations that start with "does X do Y?" and evolve through "what about Z?" can produce coherent multi-layer architectures if each layer reads the output of the layer below rather than inventing its own data model; (3) when adding new skills or commands, update the improvement-mapping.md reference if the new capability closes a gap at any literacy level
- **Improvement**: The version bump workflow (CLAUDE.md convention) worked well — every PR checked whether a bump was needed. Could be automated further with a CI check that compares plugin.json version to the latest git tag.
- **Signal**: workflow

- **Date**: 2026-04-10
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (interactive + sonnet subagents)
- **Task**: Continued session — portfolio dashboard skill, team-api skill, agent-harness-enabled topic tagging, portfolio assessment of Habitat-Thinking org, HTML dashboard generation, 23 how-to guides for all skills, 6 tutorials covering the full journey. Plugin went from v0.6.0 to v0.8.2 across PRs #91–#98.
- **Surprise**: Three parallel subagents each writing 7 how-to guides (21 total) all produced zero markdownlint errors and consistent style on first attempt. The briefing format — style reference file, skill file to read first, explicit constraints (line count, frontmatter format, no commit) — was sufficient for reliable parallel content generation at scale without review loops.
- **Proposal**: Future agents should know: (1) parallel subagent dispatch for bulk documentation works reliably when each subagent gets a style reference file to read, the source skill files to read before writing, and explicit structural constraints (line count, frontmatter format); (2) the docs site now has complete Diataxis coverage — 6 tutorials, 23 how-tos, reference pages, and 14 explanation pages — changes to skills should check whether the corresponding how-to needs updating; (3) the portfolio dashboard skill generates self-contained HTML that can be committed to the repo, which creates an interesting pattern: AI-generated artifacts that are versioned alongside the data they visualise
- **Improvement**: The how-to generation could be even faster with a template file that subagents read instead of inferring style from an example. A `docs/how-to/_template.md` with the exact structure (frontmatter, intro line, numbered steps, code blocks pattern) would remove the style inference step.

- **Date**: 2026-04-10
- **Agent**: assessor (via /assess)
- **Task**: First full AI literacy assessment of ai-literacy-superpowers
- **Surprise**: The project assessed at L5 on first assessment. The strongest signal was self-referential: the plugin originates the assessment framework it was assessed with, which makes the L5 "platform-level tooling" criterion trivially met. The interesting gap is that MODEL_ROUTING.md — a template this plugin ships — was missing from the plugin's own project. The cobbler's children.
- **Proposal**: Future agents should know: the plugin's own project should always have every artifact it templates for others. If the plugin ships a MODEL_ROUTING.md template, the project root should have a MODEL_ROUTING.md. Check for this during harness audits.
- **Improvement**: The assessment could detect "template-but-not-applied" gaps automatically — scan templates/ and check whether corresponding files exist at the project root.
- **Signal**: context
- **Constraint**: none

---

- **Date**: 2026-04-11
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (interactive + background subagents)
- **Task**: Completed all documentation gaps — three reference page stubs (commands, agents, templates), wired Article 08 into docs nav, added Human Pace how-to guide, fixed stale design spec counts, bumped to v0.9.4
- **Surprise**: Background subagents drafted all three reference pages but couldn't write files due to permission denials — had to extract content from their output logs and write from the parent context. Also, the version consistency CI check I suggested adding at the end already existed at `.github/workflows/version-check.yml`.
- **Proposal**: Future agents should know: (1) background subagents may lack Write/Edit permissions — use foreground agents for write-heavy tasks, or have the parent do the final writes; (2) before proposing new CI checks, grep `.github/workflows/` for related workflows to avoid duplicating existing enforcement; (3) the docs site now has zero "Coming Soon" stubs — all reference pages (skills, commands, agents, hooks, templates, harness-md-format) are complete
- **Improvement**: Grep for existing CI workflows before suggesting new ones. For parallel doc writing, foreground agents with approved permissions would avoid the extract-and-rewrite overhead.
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none

- **Date**: 2026-04-14
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (main conversation)
- **Task**: Added Tier 1 and Tier 2 Observatory metrics to harness health snapshots — YAML metrics block, regression detection, feedback loop tracking, session metadata in reflections, governance YAML standardisation, and configurable snapshot cadence
- **Surprise**: The files referenced in the spec existed in two locations — some at the repo root (e.g. `skills/`, `hooks/`, `templates/`) and others nested under `ai-literacy-superpowers/` (e.g. `ai-literacy-superpowers/commands/`, `ai-literacy-superpowers/agents/`). The spec used root-relative paths for all files, which required discovery to find the actual locations.
- **Proposal**: GOTCHA: Plugin files are split between the repo root and the `ai-literacy-superpowers/` subdirectory. Root-level `skills/`, `hooks/`, `templates/` are the plugin's own development files. Files under `ai-literacy-superpowers/` are the packaged plugin that gets distributed. When a spec references a file path, check both locations.
- **Improvement**: Specs that reference files across both locations should use explicit prefixes (`root:` vs `plugin:`) or full paths to avoid ambiguity. Alternatively, a file map in the spec preamble would save discovery time.

- **Date**: 2026-04-14
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (main conversation + harness-gc subagent)
- **Task**: Ran /harness-health and /harness-gc (first full run of all 7 GC rules), fixed marketplace.json drift, created issues for remaining findings (PR #120)
- **Surprise**: Three things: (1) The health badge script matches substrings — "Trend alerts: none" triggered the "alert" detector, producing a false "Degraded" status. Worked around by rephrasing to "Trend concerns: none". (2) First full GC run found 4/7 rules with findings (11 command-prompt sync issues, marketplace version stuck at 0.1.0 since creation), confirming the "silent" GC effectiveness flag was masking real entropy. (3) Re-running a failed GitHub Actions workflow reuses the original event payload — adding a label after the first run and re-triggering does not pick up the new label. A fresh push is needed to trigger a new workflow run with current label state.
- **Proposal**: Future agents should know: (1) the badge script in `scripts/update-health-badge.sh` uses substring matching on the Meta section — avoid words like "alert", "stalled", "silent", "overdue" in field names when the value is negative (e.g. use "Trend concerns: none" not "Trend alerts: none"); (2) running /harness-gc is essential to move health from "Attention" to "Healthy" — the 5 agent-scoped GC rules only execute on explicit invocation, not via CI; (3) when adding labels to exempt a PR from CI checks, push a new commit (even empty) rather than re-running the failed workflow, because GitHub Actions re-runs reuse the original event payload
- **Improvement**: The badge script should read the YAML metrics block (`observatory_metrics.observability.health`) instead of parsing the markdown Meta section with substring matching — this would eliminate the false-positive class entirely. Filed as a mental note for next plugin development session.
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none
- **Session metadata**:
  - Duration: ~30 min
  - Model tiers used: capable (harness-gc subagent), most-capable (main conversation)

- **Date**: 2026-04-14
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (main conversation)
- **Task**: Diagnosed and fixed intermittent YAML block omission in harness-health snapshots by restructuring command spec instructions
- **Surprise**: The bug was not in code but in prompt architecture. The YAML block instruction was a single trailing sentence inside the content-heaviest step of the command spec. When previous snapshots existed (adding cognitive load from trend computation and template bias from reading old snapshots that predate the YAML spec), the model would treat its job as done after writing the last markdown section. The same instruction design principles that prevent bugs in code — single responsibility, explicit contracts, verification steps — apply directly to prompt-based command specs.
- **Proposal**: GOTCHA: Command specs that instruct the model to generate multi-part output (e.g. markdown sections + YAML block) must give each part its own numbered step. Trailing instructions inside content-heavy steps are unreliable — the model loses them under cognitive load. Mandatory outputs should be marked **bold mandatory**, contrasted with conditional outputs, and include a self-verification checkpoint ("confirm the file ends with X before proceeding"). This applies to all command specs in the plugin, not just harness-health.
- **Improvement**: Audit other command specs for "trailing instruction" patterns where a required output is appended as an afterthought inside a step that already produces substantial content. The snapshot-format reference should also lead with the mandatory/conditional distinction for each section.

- **Date**: 2026-04-15
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (main conversation + governance-auditor subagent + Explore subagent)
- **Task**: Observatory signal verification (72 signals across 5 sources), Governance Summary validation checkpoint, harness health snapshot regeneration
- **Surprise**: The governance-auditor agent consistently ignored its own `## Governance Summary` format spec despite having detailed instructions (lines 92-144 of the agent file). The instructions were correct but the agent produced a loose `## Summary` section with missing fields every time — including when dispatched with explicit context about the required format. A subagent also hallucinated "23 GC rules" when there were 13 — a clean factual error on a countable quantity. Separately, the /harness-health command still generated the deprecated YAML `observatory_metrics` block (removed in v0.16.0) because the command spec did not explicitly forbid it.
- **Proposal**: GOTCHA: Agent format specs for machine-readable output (regex-parsed headings, structured field lists) need three layers of defence: (1) clear instructions in the agent file, (2) a self-check instruction telling the agent to verify its own output before returning, (3) a validation checkpoint in the dispatching command that fixes the output in place. Instructions alone are not sufficient — agents drift from structured output formats under cognitive load, especially when the report body requires substantial analysis.
- **Improvement**: The Observatory signal verification checklist should be a reusable skill or command (`/observatory-verify`) rather than a one-off prompt. It produced high-value findings (6 PARTIAL, 7 MISSING across 72 signals) and the structured table format made gaps immediately actionable.
- **Signal**: failure

- **Date**: 2026-04-15
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (main conversation + 7 haiku subagents)
- **Task**: Added output validation checkpoints to 7 commands following the governance-audit pattern, via brainstorming, spec, plan, and subagent-driven implementation. Plugin 0.19.3 to 0.19.4.
- **Surprise**: Two things: (1) The subagent-driven implementation was remarkably clean — 7 haiku-model agents dispatched in two parallel batches completed all mechanical edits with zero errors and zero review loops. The plan file in the first commit tripped the spec-first CI check (same friction as PR #143), requiring a `chore` label. (2) More fundamentally, the need for output validation checkpoints at all was surprising — commands, skills, and agents already reference detailed format templates and specs, yet agents consistently drift from those templates under cognitive load. Reference templates set intent but do not guarantee compliance. The gap between "the spec says X" and "the output actually contains X" is real and requires an explicit verification step, the same way compiled code passes a type checker even though the programmer intended correct types.
- **Proposal**: STYLE: When using subagent-driven development for mechanical edits (insert markdown section, renumber headings), haiku-model agents are sufficient and reliable. The key is a self-contained prompt with the exact content to insert and explicit renumbering instructions. No judgment calls = no need for a capable model. This scales well — 7 parallel agents completed in ~50 seconds wall time. ARCH_DECISION: Reference templates are necessary but not sufficient for structured output compliance. Every command that produces machine-readable output parsed by downstream consumers needs an explicit validation checkpoint between generation and commit — the same way a compiler enforces types even though the programmer wrote the code with correct types in mind.
- **Improvement**: Spec and plan should be committed separately (spec first, plan second) to satisfy the spec-first CI check without needing a label workaround. Future plans should note this in their Task 1.
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none

- **Date**: 2026-04-15
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (main conversation + haiku/Explore subagents)
- **Task**: Full session: harness health, governance audit, Observatory signal verification, output validation checkpoints for 8 commands, convention sync, GC workflow expansion, README/docs audit and remediation, and /harness-onboarding command. Plugin v0.19.2 to v0.20.0 across PRs #142-#157.
- **Surprise**: The plugin had strong generation capabilities but weak verification — nothing checked that structured output matched its spec. This manifested at every layer: governance-auditor ignoring its format spec, /harness-health generating deprecated YAML, docs site with a "Coming Soon" stub for the HARNESS.md format reference, README counts drifting from reality. Verification was treated as optional rather than structural. Once the checkpoint pattern was established (PR #144), it propagated to 7 more commands with haiku subagents in under a minute — the pattern was simple, the gap was recognising it was needed.
- **Proposal**: ARCH_DECISION: Every command that produces structured output parsed by downstream consumers must include a validation checkpoint step. This is not optional — it is the verification layer that makes the generation layer trustworthy. The pattern is: generate, read back, check against format spec, fix in place. Reference templates set intent; checkpoints guarantee compliance. Implemented across 8 commands; apply to any new command that generates parseable output.
- **Improvement**: A standing `/observatory-verify` command that runs the 72-signal checklist on demand would make signal contract auditing reusable. The one-off prompt found 13 gaps (6 PARTIAL, 7 MISSING) that drove most of the session's work — making it a command would let any session start with "what signals are we missing?"

- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-6 (main conversation + Explore subagent)
- **Task**: Codified validation checkpoint architectural decision (3-place: AGENTS.md + HARNESS.md + CLAUDE.md), built /harness-onboarding command (issue #37), built /observatory-verify command with 82-signal checklist. Plugin v0.20.0 to v0.21.0 across PRs #157-#159.
- **Surprise**: The reflection-to-implementation loop ran in real time. Both /harness-onboarding and /observatory-verify originated directly from the previous reflection's Proposal and Improvement fields. The architectural decision codification also came from a reflection. Three consecutive reflections each produced actionable work implemented in the same session — compound learning with minutes of latency, not days. This only worked because each proposal was self-contained (single command or constraint).
- **Proposal**: STYLE: When a reflection's Proposal or Improvement field describes something actionable and self-contained, explore implementing it in the same session while context is warm. This works when the work is a single skill/command/constraint — larger proposals should still go through spec-first planning. The three-place codification pattern (AGENTS.md decision + HARNESS.md constraint + CLAUDE.md convention) should be documented as a how-to guide for future agents — it's a reusable process for turning architectural decisions into discoverable, enforceable, and primed conventions.

- **Date**: 2026-04-16
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-7 (main conversation, no subagents)
- **Task**: Fixed marketplace.json `source` path (listing 0.2.1 → 0.2.2, PR #164) and added a `PostToolUse` hook on `Bash(gh pr merge*)` that fast-forwards `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ai-literacy-superpowers` whenever marketplace.json on origin/main differs from the cached copy (plugin 0.21.0 → 0.22.0, PR #166). Hook fired successfully on both merges within the same session — validating the design end-to-end.
- **Surprise**: Three things. (1) The `PostToolUse` hook installed mid-session via `.claude/settings.local.json` **fired on the very next `gh pr merge`** in the same session, because the settings watcher was already watching that file when the session started. Hooks added to pre-existing settings files do not require a restart to activate — an important detail for any workflow that wires up automation and wants to validate it immediately. (2) The initial narrow trigger design ("listing version changed") would have silently skipped PR #166's own merge, because #166 bumped only `plugin_version`, not listing `version`. Broadening the gate to file-diff on marketplace.json was validated in production — the hook fired and synced the cache exactly because of that decision. When users say "when X changes," interrogate whether X means the field they named or the state that field represents. (3) The cache at `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<name>/` is a full git clone (with `.git/`, working tree, remote tracking `origin/main`) — not a read-only snapshot. Treating it as a live git repo unlocks simple, reliable diff/pull operations; anything fancier (hash-of-file, API polling) would have been overengineering.
- **Proposal**: CONTEXT: Document the two-cache architecture explicitly in HARNESS.md or CLAUDE.md — `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<name>/<version>/` holds versioned plugin content (rsync'd locally by the existing `Stop` hook) and `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<name>/` is a git clone that Claude Code reads to resolve `source`. Future agents touching plugin releases need this mental model; discovering it ad hoc cost time. STYLE: Shell scripts must place `set -euo pipefail` within the first 15 lines (the "Enforce PR constraints" check counts literally). Header comments longer than ~12 lines push strict mode past the cutoff — put the directive immediately after the shebang as an invariant, not next to the code it affects.
- **Improvement**: The CHANGELOG version-consistency CI parser does a positional parse of the first token after `##`, not a regex. A date-only heading (`## 2026-04-16`) silently extracts `2026` and fails the check with a cryptic mismatch. Either the parser should be hardened (accept either a semver or skip non-semver headings) or CLAUDE.md should call out the heading format as a hard requirement alongside the existing "add a dated section" guidance. Also: `.claude/settings.local.json` is gitignored, so "workflow rules" captured in hooks there are *personal* — committing the **script** in the plugin dir while leaving the **hook wiring** in local settings is the right split, but CLAUDE.md should state the opt-in pattern explicitly (done in this PR's documentation update).

- **Task**: Added docs/tutorials/first-time-tour.md — a single-route walk through all 21 plugin capabilities in the order most useful on a first run, organised into eight phases with the sequencing rationale made explicit. PR #173, merged to main. No plugin version bump (docs-only).
- **Surprise**: The version-consistency CI failure that bit me today was explicitly documented in the 2026-04-16 reflection's Improvement field — "date-only heading silently extracts '2026' and fails with a cryptic mismatch; CLAUDE.md should call out the heading format." I hit the exact same bug two days later because REFLECTION_LOG.md Improvements are not load-bearing — they are captured but not routed anywhere that influences future sessions. The compound-learning loop has generation (we reflect) and storage (log grows) but no *retrieval* — future agents do not read the log for warnings before touching the relevant surface. This is a gap between "we captured the signal" and "the signal changed behaviour next time."
- **Proposal**: CONTEXT: Update CLAUDE.md "CHANGELOG" section to state the hard invariant enforced by CI: "Every top-level `## ...` heading MUST begin with a semver version (e.g. `## 0.22.0 — YYYY-MM-DD`). For docs-only changes that do not bump the plugin version, append entries under the most recent version's heading — do not create a dated-only top-level heading." This is the fix the previous reflection recommended; it is still unactioned. WORKFLOW: When a session's Surprise field describes a failure mode, consider running `/harness-constrain` or editing CLAUDE.md in the same session rather than leaving the fix implicit in the log. The prior reflection shows that "improvements" left to propagate organically do not propagate.
- **Improvement**: Reflections need a retrieval hook, not just a write hook. Candidate: a SessionStart-phase GC rule that scans recent REFLECTION_LOG.md Improvement fields for keywords matching the files/commands touched in the current session, and surfaces them as warnings before the work starts. The current architecture treats REFLECTION_LOG.md as a write-only audit trail; to close the learning loop it needs to be read at the right moments.

- **Agent**: claude-sonnet-4-6 (main conversation, no subagents)
- **Task**: Added advocatus-diaboli adversarial spec review — skill, agent, command, Copilot CLI prompt, orchestrator wiring, HARNESS.md constraint + GC rule, MODEL_ROUTING.md update, AGENTS.md ARCH_DECISION, README badge/table/pipeline-diagram updates, plugin v0.22.0 → v0.23.0. PR #177 merged; follow-up PR #178 added .gitkeep to docs/superpowers/objections/.
- **Surprise**: All 5 CI checks (spec-first commit ordering, version consistency, constraint enforcement, markdownlint ×2) passed on the first push — no iteration required for a 14-file, 693-insertion PR. The deeper surprise was structural: `docs/superpowers/objections/` was created with `mkdir -p` and staged, but git does not track empty directories. The directory was absent from the repo after merge, meaning the harness-enforcer's path reference and the constraint wording pointed into a location that would not exist until the first `/diaboli` run. The fix (a `.gitkeep`) is one file, but discovering the gap required a post-merge reflection — not CI.
- **Proposal**: STYLE: When a PR introduces a new directory that must exist for a constraint or agent to function correctly, always commit a `.gitkeep` in that directory as part of the implementation commit — not as a follow-up. Git's empty-directory behaviour is a well-known gotcha but easy to forget under implementation load. This applies to any `docs/`, `observability/`, or `objections/`-style directory referenced in a constraint rule.
- **Improvement**: The read-only tool boundary on the advocatus-diaboli agent (`tools: [Read, Glob, Grep]`) is the cognitive-engagement mechanism, not a security afterthought. Future agents or contributors modifying the agent definition should understand that adding Write access would silently bypass the human-disposition gate. This design intent is not obvious from the file alone — it is explained in the skill and the orchestrator, but the agent file would benefit from a short note in its Trust Boundary section (already present, but worth reinforcing in AGENTS.md if the pattern is adopted elsewhere).

- **Agent**: claude-sonnet-4-6 (main conversation, no subagents)
- **Task**: Added update-the-plugin documentation to README and docs site (three discovery signals: SessionStart hook, weekly GC rule, `claude plugin list`; `/harness-upgrade` as post-update step); fixed the Claude Code plugin update command to include the marketplace specifier (`ai-literacy-superpowers@ai-literacy-superpowers`). Two PRs: #183 and #184.
- **Surprise**: The `chore` label applied to a PR *after* creation does not affect already-triggered CI runs — the spec-first check reads labels at trigger time, so anything added post-push is invisible to the running job. The fix (push an empty no-op commit) works but leaves junk history, and we hit this exact pattern twice in the same session (PRs #183 and #184).
- **Proposal**: WORKFLOW: When a PR needs a `chore`, `fix`, or `cross-repo` label to skip a CI gate, pass `--label` directly in `gh pr create` rather than adding it after. This ensures the label is present when the first CI run is queued.
- **Improvement**: `gh pr create` accepts `--label <label>` — use it in the create command itself so the label is present at trigger time. No empty commits needed.

- **Agent**: claude-sonnet-4-6 (main conversation, no subagents)
- **Task**: Extended advocatus-diaboli from single spec-time dispatch to two dispatch points — spec-time (before plan approval) and code-time (after code-reviewer, before integration); same agent, same trust boundary, mode-based category weighting. PR #188, v0.26.0. Also added docs site review convention to CLAUDE.md and HARNESS.md constraint. PR #190.
- **Surprise**: Two things. (1) Dogfooding `/diaboli` on the spec caught real structural issues before implementation: O2 identified that `pr_ref:` in code-mode frontmatter was impossible (the PR does not exist when code-time runs — integration-agent creates it after the gate); O1 identified "after PASS" was too narrow (MAX_REVIEW_CYCLES escalation exits without a PASS). Both were spec-level gaps caught exactly where the gate was designed to catch them. (2) The docs site review gap was not caught at plan time — the user had to prompt "have we missed checking docs site changes?" mid-session after implementation was complete.
- **Proposal**: WORKFLOW: When extending an existing agent or skill to a new dispatch point, treat the dispatch context (inputs available, pipeline state) as potentially different even when core behaviour is identical. The `pr_ref:` gap arose because the spec assumed the same context as spec-time; code-time has different available inputs and different downstream state.
- **Improvement**: Plan-presentation should include docs site review as a named, visible checkpoint — not just a standing convention, but an explicit stage in the file-change list so it is not missed under implementation momentum.
- **Signal**: workflow

- **Date**: 2026-04-26
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-7 (1M context) (main conversation, no subagents)
- **Task**: Ran `/harness-upgrade` against plugin v0.26.0 (local marker was 0.22.0) and adopted two new template items (constraint + GC rule); then added `diaboli: exempt-pre-existing` frontmatter to all 26 pre-existing specs as a follow-up to keep the new "PRs have adjudicated objections" constraint from blocking future PRs that re-touch pre-existing spec lineage. PR #195.
- **Surprise**: Local main was 12 commits behind origin/main (local plugin.json said `0.22.0`; origin/main was at `0.26.0`). The `/harness-upgrade` command correctly reads the plugin version from the *marketplace cache* (which auto-syncs from `origin/main` on every PR merge via the local PostToolUse hook), but compares it against the user's *local* HARNESS.md. So the upgrade target was right (0.26.0), but the "what does main already have" mental model was wrong by 12 commits. The mismatch only surfaced when `gh pr view` reported `mergeable: CONFLICTING` after push — at which point the constraint and GC rule I had just "adopted" turned out to already exist on main (added in #186 and #190 during the 0.23–0.25 work), making half the PR redundant and requiring substantial conflict resolution. The genuinely new contribution survived (frontmatter on the 26 specs); the rest got dropped during merge.
- **Proposal**: WORKFLOW: Any harness-modifying command — `/harness-upgrade`, `/harness-constrain`, `/governance-constrain`, `/harness-init` re-runs — should perform a `git fetch origin main && git rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count` check up front and warn loudly if local main is behind. The marketplace cache reflects `origin/main` in near real time; local main can be arbitrarily stale. Reading the cache version *and* assuming local main matches it is a structural trap.
- **Improvement**: Add a step 0 to `/harness-upgrade` (and similar harness-modifying commands): "Fetch origin/main and confirm local main is current. If `git rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count` is non-zero, warn the user and offer to pull before continuing." This catches the staleness *before* the comparison work begins, rather than after a push exposes it via merge conflict.

- **Date**: 2026-04-27
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-7[1m] (acting as orchestrator-equivalent)
- **Task**: Designed and implemented the Choice Cartographer decision-archaeology agent (v0.29.0) end-to-end via the spec-first pipeline. Spec drafting, mid-flight rename from Henney, spec-mode `/diaboli` (12 objections; 9 accepted, 3 rejected), spec edits driven by accepted dispositions, implementation across 17 files, code-mode `/diaboli` (10 objections; 10 accepted, 0 rejected), remediation across 10 files, CI green, merged in PR #210. Then docs-site integration as a follow-up chore PR (#213). Two follow-up issues remain open: #209 (code-mode behaviour), #211 (story-promotion mechanism).
- **Surprise**: The `PreToolUse:Write` hook for HARNESS commit-scoped constraints fired during the `Write` of the very objection record that critiqued the missing exemption logic. The hook flagged the file as violating O3's constraint while the file's content was specifically the objection about O3 being missing — the framework's own cognitive-engagement gate fired on the file documenting that gate's incompleteness. Required falling back to a heredoc to write. Secondary surprise: the 10 code-mode objections all dispositioned `accepted` (zero rejected, zero deferred) — unusual for a code-mode review and a signal that either the diaboli was unusually solid or the implementation had genuinely many seams worth closing. The pre-existing skills.md gap (advocatus-diaboli was missing from `docs/reference/skills.md` entirely, despite the README counting 29 skills) surfaced only when adding the cartographer to that file — a docs-priming gap that had been silently present since the diaboli landed in v0.23.0 (#177).
- **Proposal**: PATTERN — Read-only chartered agents in the spec-first pipeline follow a consistent eight-component shape: (1) `agents/<name>.agent.md` with Read/Glob/Grep boundary, (2) `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with the agent's reasoning protocol, (3) `commands/<name>.md` slash command, (4) `.github/prompts/<name>.prompt.md` mirror, (5) per-spec record path under `docs/superpowers/<artefact-type>/<spec-slug>.md`, (6) `skills/<name>/references/validation-checks.md` as single-source-of-truth for the validation checkpoint, (7) `harness-enforcer.agent.md` review section enforcing the merge-time constraint, (8) observability section in `commands/superpowers-status.md` and `references/snapshot-format.md`. The cartographer was built by mirroring the diaboli ~80%; the boilerplate is templatable. Worth recording as STYLE in AGENTS.md. ARCH_DECISION — Soft gate at plan approval + hard gate at merge time is a viable alternative to hard gates everywhere when the gated artefact is curation-shaped (decisions to record) rather than risk-shaped (risks to triage). The asymmetry against the diaboli's hard plan-approval gate is deliberate and worth recording as ARCH_DECISION.
- **Improvement**: A `/scaffold-chartered-agent <name>` command would have saved real time and would have caught the missing-routing-rule-in-paired-skill bug (O1 of code-mode review) at scaffold time rather than at code-review time. The scaffold would generate all eight components from a single name input, populate cross-references, and (critically) update the paired skill's routing-rule section in lock-step. A second improvement: a `/harness-audit` check that detects when a HARNESS constraint declares logic the enforcer doesn't implement — O3 (date cutoff and frontmatter exemption flag declared but not enforced) is the kind of declarations-vs-implementation drift that the harness-auditor could surface periodically.
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none (the failures we found in code-mode review — O3, O8 — were remediated within the PR; no new HARNESS constraint surfaces from this work, and the existing "PRs have adjudicated objections" / "PRs have adjudicated choice stories" already cover the gates)

  - Duration: unknown (long session, ~3 hrs of active work given the volume of file changes; not precisely tracked)

- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-7[1m] (capturing user-supplied feedback)
- **Task**: User ran `/assess` against a real repo before and after applying a harness, and supplied five concrete pieces of feedback about what could have been improved: (1) never assume standard locations — projects customise their habitat structure; (2) look for embedded patterns — constraints may live in `AGENTS.md`, not `HARNESS.md`; (3) check multiple tool integrations — projects often use Claude + Copilot + custom tooling; (4) recognise sophistication — state-based orchestration is not the same as simple scripts; (5) validate before claiming absence — "not found in expected location" ≠ "doesn't exist". This entry captures the signal so it's preserved while the corresponding plugin amendments are scoped and shipped.
- **Surprise**: The five points decompose cleanly into two structural findings rather than five isolated bugs. Items 1, 2, and 5 are the same finding under different lenses — the assessor's *discovery* is too narrow, treating its own filename and path conventions as universal. Items 3 and 4 are a different finding — the assessor's *evidence interpretation* is too thin, missing parallel-tool configurations as habitat-maturity evidence and using surface counts (script count, hook count) where content shape would distinguish state-based orchestration from accumulated bash. The framing implication: the plugin treats its own habitat conventions as the global default, which has been a useful design simplification but is now limiting on real-world projects with their own evolved structures.
- **Proposal**: WORKFLOW — split the amendments into two work units. Unit A: discovery-layer rewrite covering items 1, 2, 5 — assessor and harness-discoverer scan for content markers (Constraints sections, Status blocks, hook lifecycle entries) across known alternative paths; recognise habitat artefacts embedded in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.cursor/rules/`; produce an auditable discovery report distinguishing "not found anywhere" from "not at default path but found at X". Unit B: evidence-base expansion covering items 3, 4 — read other-tool configs as parallel evidence sources, replace surface counts with content-shape analysis, update the literacy-improvements skill's gap-to-amendment mapping. Order matters: Unit A is foundational and benefits from being lived-with before B lands. ARCH_DECISION worth recording in AGENTS.md once Unit A ships: the assessor's discovery methodology should be auditable — every "found at alternative path X" or "not found anywhere" claim has to surface what was matched (or not matched) and why, so the user can verify rather than trust.
- **Improvement**: Beyond the two work units, two methodological patterns are worth carrying forward to all framework commands that report "X is missing": (a) every absence claim must come from a fully-completed search across known alternatives, not from "X is not at the default path"; (b) detection should be content-marker-based wherever the marker is more invariant than the location (e.g. a Constraints YAML block is a more durable marker than the filename `HARNESS.md`). These patterns may eventually deserve a reference page once they've been tried in practice — premature now, calibrated later.
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none (the amendments are agent/skill-level — they refine how the assessor and harness-discoverer behave, not a HARNESS.md constraint to enforce)
- **Session metadata**:
  - Duration: short (~15 min — receiving feedback, scoping amendments, drafting reflection)
  - Model tiers used: claude-opus-4-7[1m] throughout

- **Date**: 2026-04-28
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-7[1m]
- **Task**: Designed and implemented Unit A (discovery layer, PR #223 → v0.30.0) and Unit B (evidence-base expansion, PR #224 → v0.31.0) of the workflow signal previously captured at #221. Three new reference files added under `skills/ai-literacy-assessment/references/`: `habitat-discovery.md`, `tool-config-evidence.md`, `sophistication-markers.md`. Unit A makes the assessor's discovery content-marker-based and auditable across alternative paths; Unit B reads parallel-tool config files (Cursor / Copilot / Windsurf / custom) as L3 context-engineering evidence and replaces blind surface counts with content-shape sophistication analysis. Both PRs shipped as chore-labelled with conservative-stance notes governing how aggressively the new behaviour applies.
- **Surprise**: Two patterns emerged clearly enough to record. First: the plugin now has four instances of the "single-reference, many-consumers" idiom (the choice-cartographer's `validation-checks.md` plus the three references added today). All four follow the same shape — a `.md` file in `skills/<name>/references/`, consumed by 3-4 entry points (agent + command + SKILL + sometimes a sibling agent), edits land in one place. The idiom is firmly the way cross-cutting methodology is encoded now, not a one-off. Second: chore-label-with-version-bump held up as the right vehicle for both Unit A and Unit B, despite Unit B genuinely changing how literacy levels can be assigned. The gating-constraint exemption mechanism made this work, but the bar between "chore" and "feature flow" is now visibly calibrated: feature flow is for *net-new capability* (Choice Cartographer); chore is for *refining existing capability driven by captured signal* (the assessor's discovery layer and evidence base). Both PRs were behavioural changes, but not the same kind — and the project's existing constraints handle that distinction without further machinery.
- **Proposal**: Two AGENTS.md additions worth recording. (1) ARCH_DECISION: cross-cutting methodology lives in `skills/<skill-name>/references/<contract>.md` files, consumed by multiple agents/commands/skills via reference rather than inline. The pattern now has four instances in production; future similar work follows it without re-deciding. (2) STYLE: reflection-driven amendments may go through chore-labelled PRs even when behavioural, provided (a) the reflection captures the signal, (b) the work is scoped in a tracked issue, (c) the implementation is additive or conservatively bounded, and (d) version bump and CHANGELOG entry are honest about the behavioural change. The pattern came from this session's three behavioural-change PRs (chore PR #207 marker bump, chore PRs #223 + #224 for Units A and B); the calibration is now load-bearing.
- **Improvement**: The "conservative-stance note" pattern — explicitly bounding how aggressively new behaviour ships across a version boundary — is doing real work in keeping framework outputs stable across version bumps. Worth adopting more broadly: any PR that changes interpretation should include a conservative-stance note in the CHANGELOG and the affected SKILL/agent file. Unit B's CHANGELOG entry is the canonical example; it commits the framework to capturing a reflection after the first few real assessments using the new methodology, so the level-determination adjustments can be tuned from observed evidence rather than from speculation. The two-PR-vs-one-PR calibration is also worth carrying forward: split into multiple PRs when units differ in character (additive vs interpretive); combine when they share shape (additive + additive, or interpretive + interpretive, or both governed by the same conservative-stance note).
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none (the captured patterns are judgments that need context, not rules that can be mechanically enforced — they belong in AGENTS.md as compound learning, not in HARNESS.md as constraints)
- **Session metadata**:
  - Duration: ~1.5 hours of focused work after the prior reflection (#221) merged (Unit A scope + implementation + PR + merge, Unit B scope + implementation + PR + merge)
  - Model tiers used: claude-opus-4-7[1m] throughout (main conversation; no subagent dispatches in this session)
  - Pipeline stages completed: spec-writer (manual, both PRs scoped from the prior reflection rather than from a fresh spec), implementation (manual, both PRs), no diaboli runs (chore-labelled PRs exempt the adjudication constraints)
  - Agent delegation: manual (no orchestrator pipeline; conversation-driven, with the user adjudicating the chore-vs-feature framing for each PR)

- **Agent**: assessor (via /assess)
- **Task**: Quarterly AI literacy assessment — scan, score, document, apply habitat fixes, accept three workflow recommendations. Result: Level 5 held (third consecutive L5 assessment); ceiling stays at Guardrail Design 4.5/5 with shifted gap profile.
- **Surprise**: The compound-learning loop is half-closed in this very project that ships the closing mechanism. Capture and curation are textbook (25 entries, 84% signal-tagged, 2 patterns promoted earlier today), but read-back at session start is by convention only — there is no SessionStart hook that injects recently-curated AGENTS.md entries, even though the same architectural template is already in production for `harness-upgrade`. The cobbler's children, refracted through a new surface. The surprise isn't that this gap exists; the surprise is that the project ships the fix-pattern but has never applied it to itself.
- **Proposal**: WORKFLOW — file an issue and spec for "SessionStart hook that injects recently-promoted AGENTS.md entries (last 30 days) into the dispatched session's context" mirroring the `harness-upgrade` SessionStart hook pattern. This closes the compound-learning loop without inventing new mechanism. Worth adopting as a *general* AGENTS.md operating pattern in the plugin once it ships — downstream consumers of this plugin face the same half-closed-loop risk; the hook is the architectural answer.
- **Improvement**: One Q4-driven note: the Depletable Collaborator L5 signal is genuinely subtle and worth strengthening in the assessment skill. The current question wording ("is depletion explicitly managed") is binary-ish; the four-option scale (explicit / implicit-consistent / implicit-inconsistent / not-managed) surfaced a real distinction this assessment couldn't have caught with yes/no. Consider promoting the four-option scale into the skill's clarifying-questions reference for future runs. The interesting empirical question for the next assessment: do the Phase 7 changes (CLAUDE.md cadences, AGENTS.md depletion entry) actually shift the answer to Q4, or does the entry sit unread because of the same read-back gap?

- **Date**: 2026-04-28
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-7[1m] (main conversation; advocatus-diaboli subagent dispatch)
- **Task**: Attempted to implement the AGENTS.md read-back SessionStart hook surfaced as the highest-leverage L5 improvement in the 2026-04-28 assessment. Brainstormed → spec → plan (19 TDD tasks) → spec-mode `/diaboli`. Diaboli's O1 (premise, high) refuted the spec's foundational claim: Claude Code already loads AGENTS.md as project memory at session start, so there was no read-back gap to close. Work abandoned at the adjudication gate before implementation tokens were spent.
- **Surprise**: The assessment's Q3 framing ("read-back is by convention only") was *correct in the literal sense* (no enforcement rule says agents must read AGENTS.md) but *misleading in the implication* (it does not follow that the content fails to reach agents). The spec author — me — collapsed "no enforcement rule" into "no exposure mechanism" and built a 19-task implementation plan on the conflation. Diaboli's O1 caught it; O2 named the alternative diagnosis (signal/instrumentation gap, not exposure gap) explicitly. The mechanism worked exactly as designed: caught the misdiagnosis at the cheapest possible point in the pipeline. Counterfactual cost of NOT having diaboli at this gate: ~3 hours of implementation work + a v0.32.0 release shipping a redundant hook to all downstream consumers.
- **Proposal**: WORKFLOW — when the assessment surfaces a "gap" of the form "X is by convention only" or "X is not enforced," the spec writer must distinguish between two interpretations before designing: (a) the artefact does not reach the agent (exposure gap), and (b) we have no observation that the agent used it (signal/instrumentation gap). Q3-style answers are routinely ambiguous between (a) and (b), and the spec author defaults to (a) because exposure mechanisms are easier to design. Diaboli on a spec built from a Q3 answer is the right place to surface the ambiguity, but the spec author should pre-empt it by stating which interpretation is being targeted. This is worth carrying forward to AGENTS.md STYLE once the pattern recurs at least once more (which would also vindicate the recurring-pattern threshold for promotion); for now it is a single-instance learning. ARCH_DECISION worth recording when promoted: assessment "gap" findings carry an interpretation step that is not in the assessment itself; the spec must make the interpretation explicit and survivable to adversarial review.
- **Improvement**: The brainstorming → spec → diaboli cycle in this session worked well; the diaboli prompt I wrote for the agent specifically called out the "hybrid claim — does it actually close the loop?" question, which is what produced O3 (high), and O3 became the first chain to O1 once the agent went looking for evidence. Briefing diaboli with explicit "scrutinise these things" guidance produced more aggressive premise-level objections than a vanilla "review this spec" briefing would have. Worth carrying forward: when dispatching diaboli on specs you suspect may have premise weaknesses (i.e. specs that were written from an assessment finding without independent evidence-gathering), include explicit scrutiny pointers in the briefing — not as leading questions, but as named angles the diaboli should not skip.
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none (the lesson is judgmental — distinguishing exposure-gap from signal-gap in assessment findings cannot be mechanically enforced; it belongs in AGENTS.md STYLE as compound learning if/when the pattern recurs)

  - Diaboli outcome: spec abandoned at adjudication gate. No implementation tokens spent on hook code, tests, fixtures, or docs. v0.31.0 remains the current plugin version.

- **Date**: 2026-04-29
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-7[1m] (main conversation; no subagent dispatches)
- **Task**: Explored whether to add a "model card" workflow to the plugin (skill, command, agent, template extension, governance integration, or no-op), prompted by a Kaggle reference link. Decision: **not yet** (Option F — no-op). Reflection records the exploration so the question is not re-litigated without new signal.
- **Surprise**: Mapping Mitchell et al. (2019) model card sections against the plugin's existing surface revealed the consumer-vs-builder asymmetry sharply — six of the nine canonical sections (factors, metrics, evaluation data, training data, quantitative analyses, ethical considerations) presume access to training pipeline internals that API-consuming software engineering teams do not have. The remaining three (model details, intended use, recommendations) are already partially covered by `MODEL_ROUTING.md` and the `model-sovereignty` skill. The "industry-standard practice; we should adopt it" framing was weaker than expected once the audience asymmetry was made explicit. The yesterday-learned exposure-gap-vs-signal-gap heuristic applied cleanly: the plugin has no per-model exposure artefact (true gap, but small), and no aggregated signal of observed model behaviour (true gap, but no demand surfaced for solving it).
- **Proposal**: WORKFLOW — record this exploration so future agents/sessions encountering the same prompt ("should we add model cards?") find the deferral and the conditions for revisit. The reflection itself is the deliverable; no new skill, command, agent, template change, or governance constraint ships from this exploration.
  - **Conditions for revisit (any one is sufficient signal to re-open the question)**: (1) the project starts fine-tuning or self-hosting models in production — at that point the full Mitchell-style card becomes load-bearing for the team's own work; (2) a downstream consumer of the plugin asks for it with a concrete use case — converts "industry standard" framing into specific demand; (3) compliance pressure arrives (e.g., a customer or regulator requires per-model documentation) — at that point governance integration becomes the right entry point, not a freestanding model-cards skill; (4) REFLECTION_LOG accumulates ≥3 entries with model-specific observed-behaviour signal that isn't being aggregated anywhere — at that point the signal-gap interpretation becomes the load-bearing one and the response is observation-aggregation, not Mitchell-style cards.
- **Improvement**: The exploration applied the diaboli-vindicated heuristic from yesterday (exposure-gap vs signal-gap) BEFORE engaging brainstorming or writing-plans skills. That sequencing — strategic-fit check before formal feature design — is the pattern worth carrying forward when the user's ask is exploratory ("should we add X?") rather than directional ("add X"). It avoids the AGENTS.md SessionStart hook trap from yesterday: feature-shaped specs built from feature-shaped prompts that don't survive premise scrutiny. For exploratory prompts, the right first move is sceptical mapping against existing surface area, not jumping into brainstorming. If this pattern recurs, it would belong in AGENTS.md STYLE alongside yesterday's exposure-vs-signal heuristic; for now it is the second instance and worth noting but not promoting yet.
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none (the heuristic is judgmental, not falsifiable; belongs in compound-learning memory if/when it recurs, not in HARNESS.md as enforcement)
- **Session metadata**:
  - Duration: ~15 min (one WebFetch, one re-read of model-sovereignty skill, one synthesis pass with five options laid out, user adjudication, reflection)
  - Model tiers used: claude-opus-4-7[1m] throughout
  - Pipeline stages completed: research (existing surface area + Mitchell et al. canonical sections via WebFetch), synthesis (gap mapping, exposure-vs-signal application), options enumeration (six options with sceptical takes per option), recommendation, user adjudication, reflection
  - Agent delegation: manual (no orchestrator pipeline; conversation-driven exploration with no subagent dispatches)
  - Decision: Option F (no-op) with reflection-as-artefact

- **Date**: 2026-04-30
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-7[1m] main session; 14 model-card-researcher subagent dispatches (Opus 4.7[1m] inherited)
- **Task**: Built out the model-cards plugin's downstream surface end-to-end in one continuous session: (1) created the public `Habitat-Thinking/model-card-library` repo and seeded it with 13 frontier-model cards via 14 parallel `model-card-researcher` dispatches (1 legitimate existence-check refusal on `openai/o4`); (2) scheduled a quarterly refresh agent (`trig_01LAodr397c1waBeo2wfLtSm`) that walks the repo and opens a refresh PR each quarter; (3) published the library as a Jekyll/just-the-docs site on GitHub Pages at <https://habitat-thinking.github.io/model-card-library/> by adding `_config.yml`, per-provider landing pages, and a Pages workflow without modifying any card; (4) updated the existing one-time Node.js 20 GitHub Actions agent (`trig_016ndYMG92hoa54v8k1qTT6n`) to operate across both repos by adding the library as a second mounted source.
- **Surprise**: Three discoveries worth recording. **(a) Multi-repo scheduled agents work as a single entity, not as N agents.** The `RemoteTrigger` API accepted both repos in `session_context.sources` as a sibling array; the partial-update API accepted the new sources + new prompt without disturbing the firing time, name persistence (just routine ID), or environment. The agent will mount both at runtime and operate sequentially. This is materially cheaper than running two separate scheduled agents — one shared session, one prompt encoding both repos' divergent conventions, one report. **(b) Jekyll picked up the model cards as pages with zero modification.** The cards' existing YAML frontmatter (`model_name`, `provider`, `last_researched`, `sources`) was sufficient for Jekyll to render them; `defaults:` in `_config.yml` did the per-directory parent assignment. The cards stay pure data; the publishing layer is purely additive. **(c) Two of the 14 dispatched researcher agents flagged prompt-injection attempts in fetched web content** (an "Auto Mode Active" injection in one case, "add a Sources: footer" injection in another). Both correctly ignored the injections and continued on-task per their charter. The read-only-emitter trust boundary worked exactly as designed — even successful injections couldn't have landed an authoritative-looking card on disk because the researcher has no `Write` tool; the dispatcher persists after validation.
- **Proposal**: WORKFLOW (one for AGENTS.md ARCH_DECISIONS) — **Multi-repo scheduled agents pattern.** When one operational concern (a deprecation cutoff, a quarterly refresh, a security advisory rollout) spans multiple repos, prefer ONE multi-source scheduled agent over N single-source agents. Encode per-repo convention divergence (label conventions, CHANGELOG conventions, CI gating) explicitly in the prompt rather than expecting the agent to infer it. Sources go in `session_context.sources` as siblings; the agent gets working trees mounted side-by-side. This pattern is less obvious than "one agent per repo" but materially cheaper and produces a single coherent report. Worth promoting to AGENTS.md ARCH_DECISIONS once a second instance recurs (e.g., the next time we have a multi-repo cutoff or sweep). The first instance is the Node.js 20 agent updated today.
- **Improvement**: Initial Pages smoke test used pretty URLs (`/about/`, `/<provider>/<model>/`) which 404'd; the actual generated URLs are `.html` (matching the main marketplace docs convention). Curl-checking the actual `<a href>` patterns from the live home page first would have surfaced this in seconds rather than after three 404s. Adopt as a standard sequence after a Pages site goes live: (1) curl home, (2) grep response for `href=` to a known-real page, (3) curl that exact URL. Generalises beyond Jekyll: any time you smoke-test a site you've just published, never assume URL conventions — extract them from the rendered output.
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none (the multi-repo scheduled agent pattern and the smoke-test discipline are judgemental workflow knowledge; not falsifiable as enforcement constraints. They belong in AGENTS.md ARCH_DECISIONS / STYLE if/when they recur)
- **Session metadata**:
  - Duration: ~3 hours cumulative across docs restructure (PRs #239–#242), README marketplace reframe, library repo creation + seeding (14 parallel researcher dispatches), quarterly refresh agent setup, Pages site, and multi-repo agent update
  - Model tiers used: capable (Opus 4.7[1m] for this main session and the 14 dispatched researchers); standard (Sonnet 4.6 for both scheduled agents at their future firing time)
  - Pipeline stages completed: manual throughout; no orchestrator pipeline ran. Subagents dispatched ad-hoc: 14 `model-cards:model-card-researcher` for library seeding; 1 retry for the haiku card after a transient API error
  - Agent delegation: manual (conversation-driven, with parallel subagent dispatch for the 14-model research sweep)

- **Date**: 2026-05-01
- **Agent**: claude-opus-4-7[1m] main session; ~12 general-purpose subagent dispatches across implementer/spec-reviewer/code-reviewer roles for Phases 1-3; 1 advocatus-diaboli + 1 choice-cartographer subagent dispatch for adjudication
- **Task**: Designed, adjudicated, planned, and shipped promotion-aware reflection-log archival in ai-literacy-superpowers v0.32.0 — the very mechanism that will govern this reflection entry going forward. Full pipeline: brainstorming → spec → /diaboli (12 objections, 8 accepted driving spec revisions) → /choice-cartograph (9 stories, all accepted) → /writing-plans (32 tasks, 11 phases) → subagent-driven execution (Phases 1-3 with full implementer/spec/code review) → direct edits (Phases 4-10 for markdown-only tasks) → PR #244 merged. Three complementary mechanisms shipped: read-side filtering (immediate cost cap), Path 1 deterministic auto-archive on Promoted-line tag (weekly), Path 2 agent-augmented aged-out review emitting evidence not labels (monthly, opt-in). Includes migration helper that pre-cross-references against AGENTS.md/HARNESS.md and proposes tags for curator review.
- **Surprise**: Three discoveries worth recording. **(a) The diaboli's O3 (premise alternative — read-side filtering) caught a genuinely missed alternative.** The original spec leapt directly to archival without considering bounded reads as the cheap immediate mitigation. Once accepted, read-side filtering became a complementary mechanism, not a competitor — but the spec was meaningfully better for the catch. The exposure-gap-vs-signal-gap heuristic from the 2026-04-28 reflection applied here too: the spec misdiagnosed "growing log" as exclusively a persistence problem when part of it was a read-pattern problem. **(b) The migration helper's actual run on this repo was nearly a no-op.** The spec sized the migration as "an hour or two" of curator work and the diaboli's O6 worried about "the unstarted spring cleaning that haunts the project forever." Reality: 1 candidate, 28 recent — a 30-second decision. The spec's risk framing was correctly conservative for older logs but overstated for young projects. **(c) Bootstrap circularity.** This very reflection — capturing lessons from building the archival system — is itself the first entry the system will be asked to manage. The Path 1 GC rule will scan this entry next Monday for a `Promoted` line. If I add one when this learning gets promoted to AGENTS.md, the entry will archive itself by its own rule. The system is recursively self-applying from day zero.
- **Proposal**: WORKFLOW (one for AGENTS.md ARCH_DECISIONS) — **Read-side filtering as a peer mechanism to persistence changes.** When a design's primary failure mode is "data X grows over time", interrogate whether the harm is at the persistence layer (file size, archival, deletion) OR at the read layer (readers consume more than they need). Many "growing log" problems have a cheaper read-side mitigation that the persistence framing obscures. The diaboli surfaced this for reflection logs; the same heuristic likely applies to CHANGELOG, governance audit reports, observability snapshots, and any other long-lived markdown artefact. Worth promoting to ARCH_DECISIONS once a second instance recurs.
- **Improvement**: The 32-task plan was honest about scope but overscoped for fully-disciplined subagent-driven execution given the quota constraints we hit at Task 2's fix-loop. The pragmatic deviation — subagent-driven for the TDD-shaped shell-script tasks (Phases 1-3) where the discipline pays for itself, direct edits for the mechanical markdown updates (Phases 4-10) — produced equivalent quality at maybe 1/3 the runtime. Lesson: **for plans that mix substantial-engineering tasks with mechanical config/docs tasks, mark the seam explicitly in the plan itself** so future executions can choose the right tooling per phase rather than discovering it mid-execution. Smaller improvement: the subagent quota hit on the Task 2 fix left work on disk but unstaged — the controller should always check `git status` before re-dispatching to avoid duplicating work.
- **Signal**: workflow
- **Constraint**: none (the read-side-filtering-as-peer-mechanism heuristic and the plan-the-seam-between-substantial-and-mechanical-tasks lesson are judgemental workflow knowledge, not falsifiable as enforcement constraints. They belong in AGENTS.md ARCH_DECISIONS / STYLE if/when they recur)
- **Session metadata**:
  - Duration: ~6 hours cumulative (continued from prior day's docs/library work; today: brainstorming through merge of PR #244)
  - Model tiers used: capable (Opus 4.7[1m] for this main session and all dispatched subagents). Subagents inherited the parent session's model rather than running on a smaller tier — the implementer/reviewer subagents could plausibly have run on Sonnet, but did not. The two scheduled agents (Node.js cutoff, library refresh) are configured for Sonnet at their future firing times.
  - Pipeline stages completed: brainstorming (skill-driven, 3 clarifying questions + design proposal); spec-writer (manual via skill, 5,335 words); /diaboli (12 objections, 8 accepted, 4 rejected); /choice-cartograph (9 stories, all accepted); /writing-plans (32 tasks, 2,237 lines); subagent-driven-development partial (Phases 1-3 implementer + spec + code review); direct execution (Phases 4-10); PR open + green + merged
  - Agent delegation: partial pipeline — spec/objections/cartograph/plan stages each used a single subagent dispatch via their respective skills. Execution split: Phases 1-3 ran via subagent-driven-development (~12 dispatches: 4 implementers + 4 spec reviewers + 4 code-quality reviewers, with one Task-2 fix dispatch hitting usage limit and one direct-fix recovery). Phases 4-10 ran via direct Edit tool calls without subagent dispatch given the mechanical markdown-only scope and the quota signal.
