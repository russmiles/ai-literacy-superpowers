"""Phase 4 — model-mediated-command skill-coverage matrix.

Model-mediated commands derive their substantive behaviour from
their driving skill. ``/assess`` reads the ``ai-literacy-assessment``
skill before proceeding; ``/extract-conventions`` reads the
``convention-extraction`` skill; ``/governance-constrain`` reads the
``governance-constraint-design`` skill. The skill encodes the actual
methodology; the command's prose is the conversational shell that
loads the skill at the right time.

This makes model-mediated commands fragile in a specific way: if the driving
skill is renamed, refactored, or split without updating the
referencing command, the command's prose still reads (Phase 1 may
not catch it if the rename split into two skills, both of which
exist), but the command no longer loads the methodology it was
supposed to load. The user gets a guided session driven by whatever
the model improvises in the absence of the missing skill.

This test catches that. It mirrors Phase 3's dispatch-matrix shape
for the skill-driven layer:

- Phase 1 catches "skill reference is broken" (passive — fails when
  the named skill no longer exists).
- Phase 4 catches "model-mediated command was supposed to load Y skill and no
  longer does" (active — fails when an expected reference is
  missing, even if the command's prose still parses cleanly).

The two tests have orthogonal coverage. Both belong.

Per the design spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-command-tdad-testing-design.md`),
Layer 3 behavioural tests of model-mediated-command driving skills are the
high-cost, case-by-case follow-up — only worth investing in for
specific skills with assertable side-effects (the ``cupid-code-review``
test in PR #285 is the canonical pattern; ``harness-onboarding`` is a
candidate because it produces an ONBOARDING.md). Those Layer 3 tests
are *not* part of this Phase 4 spike — Phase 4's contribution is the
cheap-and-immediate skill-coverage matrix.
