"""Phase 2 spike — convention-sync helper tests.

Validates the per-category strategy from the design spec
(``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-command-tdad-testing-design.md``)
for one procedural command. The helper at
``tdad_tests/spike_helpers/convention_sync.py`` implements the Cursor
``conventions.mdc`` slice of ``/convention-sync``; these tests cover
its behaviour against fixture HARNESS.md inputs.

Three cases earn their keep:

- ``parse_context`` extracts Stack and Conventions correctly from a
  fixture HARNESS.md with both subsections populated.
- ``render_cursor_conventions_mdc`` produces output that matches the
  format documented in
  ``ai-literacy-superpowers/skills/convention-sync/SKILL.md`` —
  frontmatter present, headings in order, body content preserved.
- ``sync_cursor_conventions`` (end-to-end) writes to disk and raises
  a clear error when HARNESS.md is missing.

These are pure offline tests — no LLM, no SDK invocation. Cost: $0.
