"""Shared pytest fixtures for the TDAB external test suite.

The fixtures here exist to keep individual tests focused on what they are
asserting rather than on the plumbing that gets them into a position to
assert. Three fixtures earn their keep:

- ``plugin_path`` resolves the on-disk location of the packaged plugin so
  tests can read agent, skill, and command files without hard-coding paths.
  Using a fixture (rather than a module-level constant) means the resolution
  logic lives in one place and can be overridden in a future per-environment
  layout (e.g. CI runners).

- ``needs_api`` is the gate that turns Layer 2 and Layer 3 tests into
  no-ops when no API key is present. Spike philosophy: tests must be
  runnable on a developer machine without surprises. Layer 1 stays free
  and fast; the cost-bearing layers are opt-in via environment.

- ``violation_fixture_path`` returns the path to the fixture code that
  the cupid-code-review skill is expected to find faults in. Centralising
  the path keeps the scenario file and the test in agreement.

These fixtures are deliberately not parametrised over the full plugin
component inventory. The spike tests three named components; the runner
that scales to all 71 will need its own parametrisation pass.
