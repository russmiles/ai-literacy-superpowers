### Tier 1 Feature: Auto-Enforcer GitHub Action

- Add `auto-enforcer-action` skill for setting up automatic PR constraint
  checking via GitHub Actions

  (advisory PR comments) on every pull request
- Update `harness-init` to offer auto-enforcer setup when agent PR
  constraints exist

### Tier 1 Feature: Convention Sync Across AI Tools

- Add `convention-sync` skill — reads HARNESS.md and generates convention
  files for Cursor (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), Copilot
  (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`), and Windsurf (`.windsurf/rules/`)
- Add `/convention-sync` slash command for direct invocation
- Add "Convention file sync" GC rule to HARNESS.md template for weekly
  drift detection

### Tier 1 Feature: Architectural Fitness Functions

- Add `fitness-functions` skill with catalogue of periodic architectural
  checks (structural, coupling, complexity/hotspot, coverage)
- Add reference catalogue with concrete HARNESS.md GC rule entries and
  tool commands per language ecosystem
- Add fitness functions as sixth category in the GC skill and catalogue
- Add commented-out fitness function examples to HARNESS.md template

- Add `secrets-check.sh` Stop-scope hook script for advisory gitleaks
  scanning at session end
- Wire hook into `hooks.json` and add gitleaks discovery to
  `/harness-init` constraint setup

### Project Harness Initialization

  `snapshot-staleness-check.sh`, and `update-health-badge.sh`
- Promote ShellCheck constraint from unverified to deterministic
  (5/6 constraints enforced)
- Add harness enforcement and health badges to README
