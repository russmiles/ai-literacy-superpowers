# Changelog

## 0.30.0 — 2026-04-28

### Feature — Discovery layer for assessor and harness-discoverer (Unit A)

Implements Unit A of the workflow signal captured in REFLECTION_LOG.md
(2026-04-28 entry): the `/assess` discovery is no longer rigid about
default paths and filenames. Items 1, 2, and 5 of the user-supplied
feedback decomposed to a single structural fix; this release ships
that fix.

- Add `skills/ai-literacy-assessment/references/habitat-discovery.md`
  — single source of truth for habitat document discovery covering
  `HARNESS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`. Documents alternative
  paths to scan, content markers per document type, the discovery
  report format with citations, and the two failure modes
  (ambiguous discovery surfaces both candidates; genuine absence
  lists every path checked).
- Modify `agents/assessor.agent.md` Phase 1: split into 1a (habitat
  document discovery using the new reference) and 1b (broader
  signal scan). Discovery completes — with auditable absence claims
  — before any maturity calculation.
- Modify `agents/harness-discoverer.agent.md` step 5: convention
  documentation discovery now applies the new reference rather than
  defaulting to `CLAUDE.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` only.
- Modify `commands/assess.md`: step 1 split into 1a (discovery
  report as the first output) and 1b (broader scan). Ambiguous
  discovery results halt the flow until the user resolves; silent
  picks are forbidden.
- Modify `skills/ai-literacy-assessment/SKILL.md`: Phase 1
  (Observable Evidence) prefaced with the discovery methodology
  note — habitat documents found at non-conventional paths count
  as *present* for Level 3 indicators.

The principle the discovery layer encodes: **every absence claim
must come from a fully-completed search across known alternatives,
not from "not at the default path"**. Discovery output is auditable
— each finding cites the path matched and the marker confirmed.

Unit B (evidence-base expansion — multi-tool config reading,
content-shape analysis, literacy-improvements gap-to-amendment
mapping update) is a separate follow-up. Issue #222 closes when
Unit A merges; a new issue tracks Unit B.

## 0.29.0 — 2026-04-27

### Docs — Determinacy Calibration explanation and how-to

- Add `docs/explanation/determinacy-calibration.md` — explanation page
  on calibration as a periodic review practice, covering bidirectional
  movement (promotion, demotion, splitting, seam repair, leaving
  unchanged), the four signal classes (change records, temporal
  patterns, reflection-log patterns, seam integrity), recording
  refusals as a first-class output, and the relationship to
  `/harness-audit`, `/harness-gc`, and `/reflect`. Builds on Russ
  Miles' [The Djinn's Determinacy Drift](https://www.softwareenchiridion.com/p/the-djinns-determinacy-drift)
  for the bidirectional-drift framing and the harness-as-habitat
  metaphor.
- Add `docs/how-to/run-a-calibration-review.md` — practical guide
  for running a periodic calibration review: cadence selection,
  signal gathering, candidate movements, decision recording with
  refusals, applying decisions through existing commands, and a
  follow-up audit.
- Cross-links added in `progressive-hardening.md` (the unidirectional
  promotion framing's bidirectional companion) and the explanation
  `index.md` "Deep dives" section.

### Docs — HARNESS.md overview page

- Add `docs/explanation/harness-md.md` — explanation page covering what
  `HARNESS.md` is, how it is operated, and how it compares to
  `AGENTS.md`, CI config, and hooks. Builds on Addy Osmani's
  [Agent Harness Engineering](https://addyosmani.com/blog/agent-harness-engineering/)
  for the model-plus-harness framing alongside the project's
  Boeckeler-derived foundation. Includes the AGENTS.md vs HARNESS.md
  differences-at-a-glance table and addresses the source-code-vs-binary
  metaphor for "do we keep this around" with the single-source-of-truth
  tension.
- Cross-links added in `harness-engineering.md`, `self-improving-harness.md`,
  and the explanation `index.md` "Deep dives" section so the new page
  is discoverable from related entry points.
- Restructured "How HARNESS.md is operated" section to add a Signal
  capture flow that explicitly documents reflections as the primary
  signal source feeding HARNESS.md amendments (alongside audit
  findings and direct human authoring). The original three-flow
  shape elided where amendments come from; the four-flow shape makes
  the reflection-driven ratchet (every preventable mistake becomes a
  rule) load-bearing in the prose.
- Expanded the Signal capture flow from three pathways to seven to
  cover the full set of plugin features that route into
  `HARNESS.md` amendments: reflections, audit/GC findings,
  convention extraction (`/extract-conventions`), assessment-driven
  improvements (`/assess` + `literacy-improvements`), affordance
  discovery and sibling-artefact promotion (`/harness-affordance
  discover` and choice-story `disposition: promoted`), template
  upgrades (`/harness-upgrade`), and direct human authoring. The
  ordering goes from continuous observation through structured
  elicitation to escape hatch.

### Docs — Choice Cartographer integration into docs site

- `docs/reference/agents.md`: add `choice-cartographer` entry alongside
  `advocatus-diaboli` with Routing Rule cross-reference; bump count from
  12 to 13; expand pipeline-agents framing to seven agents with two
  human gates (hard + soft); add row to the Tool Summary table.
- `docs/reference/commands.md`: add `/choice-cartograph` entry under
  Workflow with disposition values and merge-time gate context; bump
  count from 23 to 24.
- `docs/reference/skills.md`: add new "Spec-First Pipeline" section
  containing both `advocatus-diaboli` and `choice-cartographer` skill
  entries; bump count from 28 to 30 (advocatus-diaboli was missing too
  and is now added under the new section).
- `docs/explanation/agent-orchestration.md`: insert Choice Cartographer
  step into the pipeline diagram; expand "Two things matter here" to
  three to cover the soft-gate / hard-gate asymmetry; add cross-link to
  `decision-archaeology.md`.
- `docs/explanation/adversarial-review.md`: add Further Reading links
  to `decision-archaeology.md` and `run-choice-cartograph.md` so the
  paired agents are discoverable from each other.
- `docs/index.md`: bump skills/agents/commands counts to 30/13/24 and
  call out decision-archaeology in the value bullets.

### Feature — Choice Cartographer (decision-archaeology agent)

- Add `agents/choice-cartographer.agent.md` — second chartered read-only
  agent in the spec-first pipeline (Read/Glob/Grep boundary). Runs after
  spec-mode `/diaboli` dispositions are resolved and before plan approval;
  surfaces decisions a spec has made implicitly and emits each as a
  *choice story* (Henney pattern story) for human disposition.
- Add `skills/choice-cartographer/SKILL.md` — six lenses (forces,
  alternatives, defaults, patterns, consequences, coherence), the
  Routing Rule (failure-vs-decision test that partitions findings
  between Cartographer and diaboli), self-imposed selectivity cap (15)
  inside the reasoning protocol, output format, cross-reference
  protocol with deterministic resolution.
- Add `commands/choice-cartograph.md` — `/choice-cartograph <spec-path>`
  with single positional argument (no `--mode` flag this release;
  code-mode tracked at issue #209). Validation checkpoint includes
  cross-reference resolution for `O\d+` and `#\d+` tokens in `Refs`
  fields. Selectivity cap is enforced in the agent's reasoning, so the
  validator never refuses to write — fix-in-place pattern preserved.
- Add `.github/prompts/choice-cartograph.prompt.md` — prompt mirror
  for `/prompts` discovery in Copilot CLI.
- Add `docs/how-to/run-choice-cartograph.md` — task-oriented guide
  covering invocation, output, the Routing Rule, and the disposition
  workflow.
- Add `docs/explanation/decision-archaeology.md` — conceptual page on
  intent debt, cognitive debt, the cartography role frame, the
  Routing Rule, soft-vs-hard gating, and the relationship to ADRs.
- Modify `agents/orchestrator.agent.md` — insert step 1b after
  spec-mode diaboli adjudication and before plan approval; surface
  `cartograph_pending_count: N` as a structured field in the
  plan-approval summary; allow progression with pending dispositions.
- Modify `agents/harness-enforcer.agent.md` — add Choice Story
  Adjudication Review section that mirrors the diaboli adjudication
  check for the new `PRs have adjudicated choice stories` constraint.
- Modify `templates/HARNESS.md` — add `PRs have adjudicated choice
  stories` constraint (agent-enforced via harness-enforcer, scope
  `pr`); bump template-version marker to 0.29.0.
- Modify `HARNESS.md` (this project) — adopt the new constraint
  locally; bump template-version marker to 0.29.0.
- Modify `commands/superpowers-status.md` — add Section 8 (Cartographer
  activity) with `cartograph_pending_count`, fully-resolved rate,
  disposition distribution, and lens distribution; add Cartographer
  line to the dashboard summary.
- Modify `commands/harness-health.md` — add Cartographer to the
  snapshot section list (now 14 sections instead of 13).
- Modify `skills/harness-observability/references/snapshot-format.md`
  — add Cartographer section spec parallel to the Diaboli section,
  with `cartograph_pending_count` documented as the load-bearing
  field tracked by the merge-time HARNESS constraint.
- The Cartographer's plan-approval gate is **soft** by design — it
  surfaces `cartograph_pending_count` and allows progression, while
  the merge-time HARNESS constraint blocks PR merge until every story
  has `disposition != pending`. The asymmetry against the diaboli's
  hard plan-approval gate is deliberate: a `pending` objection is a
  risk that has not been triaged; a `pending` choice story is a
  captured decision waiting for human curation.
- Format vocabulary preserves the Henney pattern-stories lineage —
  each entry is a *choice story* and the format follows POSA Vol. 5;
  the Cartographer name reflects the agent's role (mapping the
  implicit decision terrain) rather than the format's source.
- Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-choice-cartographer.md`.
  Adjudicated diaboli objection record at
  `docs/superpowers/objections/choice-cartographer.md` — 12 objections,
  9 accepted, 3 rejected. Follow-up issues: code-mode at #209,
  story-promotion mechanism at #211.

## 0.28.0 — 2026-04-27

### Chore — harness marker bump

- Bump `HARNESS.md` template-version marker from 0.26.0 to 0.28.0 after
  running `/harness-upgrade` (issue #206). No new template content to
  adopt — the plugin's `templates/HARNESS.md` carries internal marker
  0.19.0, and the project HARNESS.md already contains every active rule
  and commented block in the template plus many project-specific
  additions. The bump records that v0.28.0 has been reviewed.

### Feature — `/harness-affordance discover` (sequencing step 2 of harness-affordances)

- Add `commands/harness-affordance.md` — parent command for the
  affordance inventory workflow with three subcommands: `discover`
  (implemented), `add` (planned, sequencing step 3), `review`
  (planned, sequencing step 6). `add` and `review` print a clear
  "not yet implemented" message pointing at the design spec.
- Add `scripts/harness-affordance-discover.sh` — bash discovery
  scanner that reads `.claude/settings.json`,
  `.claude/settings.local.json`, and `.mcp.json`, deriving one draft
  affordance per permission pattern, hook entry, and MCP server.
  Output goes to `<project>/.claude/affordance-discovery-<date>.md`,
  never to `HARNESS.md`. Idempotent — re-running on the same input
  produces the same output modulo the date in the heading.
- Output entries fill machine-derivable fields (Mode, Trigger for
  hooks, Permission) and leave human-owned governance fields
  (Identity, Audit trail, Notes) as `TODO` placeholders.
- Disambiguates colliding derived names by appending numeric
  suffixes (`awk-cli`, `awk-cli-2`, ...).
- Cross-checks `.mcp.json` against permission allowlists and
  warns when an MCP server is declared without a matching
  `mcp__<server>__*` permission entry.
- Add `docs/how-to/discover-affordances.md` — one-page guide
  covering prerequisites (jq), invocation, output structure, and
  the promote-to-HARNESS.md flow.
- Update `.gitignore` to exclude `.claude/affordance-discovery-*.md`
  so drafts never accidentally land in version control.
- Update README Commands count badge from 22 to 23 and Commands
  table to include `/harness-affordance`.
- This is the **backfill path** for existing harness adopters
  promised by sequencing step 2 of the affordances design — running
  the scanner once produces a draft for every existing permission,
  hook, and MCP server in any project that already declared them.

## 0.27.0 — 2026-04-26

### Commands — sync check on /harness-upgrade and PR workflow on /reflect

- Update `commands/harness-upgrade.md` step 1 — fetch `origin/main` and
  warn when the local clone is behind. The marketplace cache reflects
  `origin/main` in near real time, so a stale local clone produces an
  upgrade comparison that suggests content already on main and yields a
  conflicting PR at push time. Best-effort: skipped silently if no
  remote main, detached HEAD, or fetch failure
- Update `commands/reflect.md` step 7 — replace the unconditional
  `git commit` with a branch + labelled-PR workflow when the project
  declares a "Reflections via PR workflow" constraint, and keep direct
  commit as the fallback when no such constraint is declared. The PR
  variant uses `--label chore` on `gh pr create` directly so the
  spec-first and adjudicated-objections gates exempt the reflection
- Both updates trace to a reflection in PR #196 captured during the
  /harness-upgrade run that produced PRs #195 and #196

## 0.26.0 — 2026-04-19

### Harness — bump local template marker and exempt pre-existing specs

- Bump `HARNESS.md` template-version marker `0.25.0` → `0.26.0` to reflect
  the installed plugin version (the constraint and GC rule themselves
  already shipped under this version above)
- Add `diaboli: exempt-pre-existing` frontmatter to all 26 specs in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/` — belt-and-braces alongside the date cutoff
  in the "PRs have adjudicated objections" rule, so the exemption is
  explicit and greppable per file
- Drive-by: add the blank line MD032 wants before a list in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-observatory-verify-design.md`
- No plugin version bump — `HARNESS.md` and `docs/superpowers/specs/`
  are outside `ai-literacy-superpowers/` (0.26.0 retained)

### Feature — diaboli code-time dispatch point

- Add Dispatch Modes section to `skills/advocatus-diaboli/SKILL.md` documenting
  spec-time weighting (premise, alternatives, scope, specification quality) and
  code-time weighting (risk, implementation); six categories and trust boundary
  unchanged across modes
- Update `agents/advocatus-diaboli.agent.md` to accept `mode: spec|code` input
  (default `spec`); apply mode-appropriate weighting; write to
  `docs/superpowers/objections/<slug>.md` (spec mode) or
  `docs/superpowers/objections/<slug>-code.md` (code mode); add `mode:` field to
  frontmatter
- Update `commands/diaboli.md` and `.github/prompts/diaboli.prompt.md` to accept
  optional `--mode` flag; extend validation checkpoint to verify `mode:` field and
  mode-appropriate required frontmatter fields explicitly
- Update `agents/orchestrator.agent.md` — add code-time dispatch (step 4a) after
  code-reviewer loop exits (PASS or escalation); add Integration Approval gate
  that refuses while any code-mode disposition is `pending`; extend context object
  with `code_diaboli_slug` field
- Rename HARNESS.md constraint from "Spec has adjudicated objections" to "PRs have
  adjudicated objections"; extend rule to require both spec-mode and code-mode
  records; extend "Objection record freshness" GC rule to cover both record types
- Extend `commands/superpowers-status.md` Section 7 Diaboli panel with mode-split
  breakdown (spec-mode and code-mode separately) and overall totals for backward
  compatibility
- Extend `skills/harness-observability/references/snapshot-format.md` Diaboli
  section with mode-split field definitions and computation table
- Update `skills/advocatus-diaboli/references/observability.md` with mode-split
  field definitions and cross-mode interpretation patterns (code-time counts
  trending up/down, distribution divergence)
- Update `MODEL_ROUTING.md` and `templates/MODEL_ROUTING.md` — note code-time
  dispatch routes to most-capable tier; judgment load equivalent across modes
- Update `templates/HARNESS.md` — extended constraint and GC rule for new projects
- Add ARCH_DECISION to `AGENTS.md` — one agent, two dispatches; alternatives
  considered and rejected; conditions for revisit at 20+ PRs
- Update `README.md` — pipeline diagram shows both dispatch points and both gates;
  Agents table row updated; agent count unchanged at 12
- Update `docs/explanation/adversarial-review.md` — intro and three-loops section
  describe both dispatch modes; disposition patterns section notes mode-split stats
- Update `docs/how-to/review-a-spec-adversarially.md` — code mode documented with
  `--mode code` flag, output path, and integration-approval gate

## 0.25.0 — 2026-04-19

### Feature — diaboli observability panel

- Add Diaboli panel to `commands/superpowers-status.md` (Section 7) — surfaces
  in-scope vs exempt spec count, objection records present, in-scope specs without
  a record, fully-resolved record rate, objections total with severity breakdown,
  mean objections per spec, disposition distribution, and median days
  spec-to-disposition; summary uses standard `OK`/`MISSING` tokens; error handling
  for malformed YAML frontmatter
- Add Diaboli section to snapshot format (`skills/harness-observability/references/
  snapshot-format.md`) after Session Quality and before Operational Cadence, with
  field computation table
- Update `commands/harness-health.md` — Diaboli included in required section list;
  step 7 validation updated from 12 to 13 required section headings with Diaboli
  in enumerated list
- Update `skills/harness-observability/SKILL.md` — reference to Diaboli panel added
- Add `skills/advocatus-diaboli/references/observability.md` — metric computation
  definitions, interpretive notes, and watch-for patterns (what each field means
  and what it does NOT mean)
- Fix `commands/diaboli.md` validation checkpoint — category and severity taxonomy
  corrected to match SKILL.md: premise/scope/implementation/risk/alternatives/
  specification quality and critical/high/medium/low
- Add ARCH_DECISION to `AGENTS.md` — observability-before-enforcement principle,
  revisit conditions (10 fully-resolved records or 2026-07-19)
- Update `docs/explanation/adversarial-review.md` — disposition patterns section
  now references Diaboli panel surfaces; three-loops section adds observability loop
- Update `docs/how-to/review-a-spec-adversarially.md` — "What you have now" notes
  that disposition patterns accumulate and are visible in status/health surfaces

## 0.24.0 — 2026-04-19

### Docs and taxonomy — advocatus-diaboli coverage and SKILL.md update

- Add `docs/explanation/adversarial-review.md` — standalone explanation of
  the Promoter Fidei precedent, Popperian falsifiability, the Schopenhauer
  non-goal, the human-cognition gate, and disposition patterns as signals
- Add `docs/how-to/review-a-spec-adversarially.md` — practical guide for
  running `/diaboli`, reading the objection record, and writing dispositions
- Update `docs/reference/commands.md` — add `/diaboli` entry with correct
  taxonomy; count updated to 22
- Update `docs/reference/agents.md` — add `advocatus-diaboli` agent entry;
  count updated to 12; pipeline description updated to six-stage sequence
- Update `docs/explanation/agent-orchestration.md` — pipeline diagram now
  shows advocatus-diaboli and two human gates; "Where This Breaks Down"
  names the structural solution; duplicate link removed from Further Reading
- Update `docs/tutorials/first-time-tour.md` — `/diaboli` section added;
  count updated to twenty-two
- Update `skills/advocatus-diaboli/SKILL.md` — category taxonomy updated
  to premise/scope/implementation/risk/alternatives/specification quality;
  severity updated to critical/high/medium/low (replaces major/minor);
  change driven by spec-first review of the docs work itself via /diaboli

## 0.23.0 — 2026-04-19

### Feature — advocatus-diaboli adversarial spec review

- Add `skills/advocatus-diaboli/SKILL.md` — charter for the adversarial
  spec reviewer: six objection categories (premise, design, threat, failure,
  operational, cost), severity levels (major/minor), 12-objection cap,
  evidence requirement per objection, mandatory "Explicitly not objecting to"
  section; intellectual foundations grounded in the historical Promoter of
  the Faith, Popper on falsifiability, and an explicit anti-Schopenhauer
  framing (no rhetorical tricks, no winning for its own sake)
- Add `agents/advocatus-diaboli.agent.md` — read-only agent (Read/Glob/Grep
  only) that reads a spec and returns objection record content to the
  orchestrator; disposition fields cannot be written by any agent — this
  constraint is the human-cognition gate
- Add `commands/diaboli.md` — `/diaboli <spec-path>` for manual invocation
  and regeneration; includes a 10-point validation checkpoint per the
  output-validation-checkpoints constraint
- Add `.github/prompts/diaboli.prompt.md` — Copilot CLI equivalent
- Update `agents/orchestrator.agent.md` — pipeline is now: spec-writer →
  advocatus-diaboli → GATE (objection adjudication, blocked on `pending`) →
  GATE (plan approval with adjudicated record) → tdd-agent → …
- Update `HARNESS.md` — add "Spec has adjudicated objections" constraint
  (agent-enforced, scope pr) with pre-2026-04-19 exemption; add "Objection
  record freshness" GC rule (deterministic, weekly)
- Update `templates/HARNESS.md` — new projects scaffolded by `/superpowers-init`
  inherit both the constraint and the GC rule
- Update `MODEL_ROUTING.md` — advocatus-diaboli routed to most-capable tier
  (judgment-heavy, not throughput-heavy)
- Update `AGENTS.md` — ARCH_DECISION: diaboli hard-wired as PR constraint
  from the outset; rejected alternatives documented (manual-only, advisory
  gate, deterministic schema check alone)
- Create `docs/superpowers/objections/` — directory for objection records

## 0.22.0 — 2026-04-17

### Docs — first-time tour tutorial

- Add `docs/tutorials/first-time-tour.md` — a single route through
  every plugin capability in the order it is most useful on a first
  run, with the reason each step comes where it does; grouped into
  eight phases (orient, foundation, measure, adjust, learning loop,
  governance, cadence, share and scale) plus two day-to-day
  capabilities (`/worktree`, `/harness-upgrade`)
- Point `docs/tutorials/getting-started.md` "Next Steps" at the new
  tour so first-time users land on it naturally after the
  installation walkthrough
- Docs-only change; no plugin version bump (0.22.0 retained)

### Docs — surfacing-tacit-knowledge tutorial

- Add `docs/tutorials/surfacing-tacit-knowledge.md` — a five-phase
  walkthrough for turning tacit team knowledge into versioned,
  enforceable artefacts: scaffold the habitat with
  `/superpowers-init`, run guided extraction with
  `/extract-conventions`, mine existing code/PRs/wikis with AI,
  introduce lightweight ADRs captured in flow (plus `/reflect` for
  micro-decisions), and generate team-specific onboarding with
  `/harness-onboarding`. Each command is explained in terms of why
  it comes where it does and what it produces, with an ATM
  scheduling-service running example and a closing flywheel that
  turns the one-time exercise into a quarterly habit
- Docs-only change; no plugin version bump (0.22.0 retained)

### CLAUDE.md — CHANGELOG heading format made explicit

- Rewrite the "CHANGELOG" section of `CLAUDE.md` to state the hard
  invariant enforced by the `Check version consistency` CI step:
  every top-level `## ...` heading MUST begin with a semver version
  (`## X.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD`). Date-only headings silently parse as the
  first token (for example `2026`) and fail CI with a cryptic
  mismatch error.
- Make the docs-only path explicit: append entries under the most
  recent version's heading; do not create a new top-level heading
  without a version. Closes the recommendation from the 2026-04-16
  reflection that had gone unactioned and caused a repeat CI failure
  on PR #173 (captured in the 2026-04-18 reflection).

### Harness template-version marker bump

- Bump `HARNESS.md` template-version marker 0.21.0 → 0.22.0 after
  running `/harness-upgrade`; no new constraints, GC rules, or sections
  to adopt (template content is unchanged since 0.19.0 — the plugin
  version advanced three releases without template edits)
- Silences the template-currency GC finding until the next plugin
  upgrade introduces new template content

### Marketplace source schema fix

- Fix `source` field in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — bare string
  form (`"ai-literacy-superpowers"`) from #164 is rejected by the
  Claude Code marketplace schema with `plugins.0.source: Invalid input`;
  restore the required `./` prefix (`"./ai-literacy-superpowers"`) so
  `claude plugin marketplace add Habitat-Thinking/ai-literacy-superpowers`
  parses again
- Bump listing `version` 0.2.2 → 0.2.3 (source path is a listing
  contract change per CLAUDE.md); `plugin_version` unchanged
- Documented behaviour: marketplace `source` as a plain string must be
  a relative path starting with `./`; the runtime resolves it to the
  plugin directory and loads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` from there

### Copilot CLI install instructions

- Fix README Copilot CLI install block — add missing
  `copilot plugin marketplace add` step and correct the install
  command to `copilot plugin install ai-literacy-superpowers@ai-literacy-superpowers`
  so users on Copilot CLI can actually install the plugin without
  hitting "plugin not found"
- Mirror the corrected install block in `docs/index.md` Quick Install
  so the docs site and README agree; Claude Code and Copilot CLI
  steps are now shown side-by-side in both places
- Partial fix for #168 (leaves `docs/how-to/install-the-plugin.md`
  how-to page and `docs/tutorials/getting-started.md` tutorial-step
  update for a follow-up)

### Marketplace cache auto-sync

- Add `ai-literacy-superpowers/scripts/sync-marketplace-cache.sh` —
  fast-forwards `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ai-literacy-superpowers`
  when `marketplace.json` on `origin/main` differs from the cached
  copy (any byte difference — covers listing version, `plugin_version`,
  and per-plugin version bumps); no-ops silently when cache missing,
  offline, or already current
- Complements the existing `sync-to-global-cache.sh` (plugin content
  sync); this script handles the marketplace-clone side
- Wire via a `PostToolUse` hook on `Bash(gh pr merge*)` in
  `.claude/settings.local.json` so the cache refreshes the moment a
  marketplace-affecting PR is merged through the CLI
- Document the rule under **Marketplace Cache Auto-Sync** in CLAUDE.md
  so collaborators can opt in by adding the same hook locally

## 0.21.0 — 2026-04-15

### Observatory signal verification

- Add /observatory-verify command — runs the 82-signal checklist
  against the latest output files, reporting PRESENT/PARTIAL/MISSING
  status for each signal the Observatory expects to read
- Add observatory-signals.md reference — the authoritative checklist
  of all signals across 5 sources (snapshot, governance, reflections,
  HARNESS.md, assessments)

## 0.20.0 — 2026-04-15

### Human-readable harness onboarding

- Add /harness-onboarding command — generates ONBOARDING.md from
  HARNESS.md, AGENTS.md, and REFLECTION_LOG.md for new team members
- Add harness-onboarding skill — tone guidelines and section mapping
  for human-readable onboarding document generation
- Add ONBOARDING.md template with 10 section skeleton and placeholder
  markers
- Add onboarding document staleness GC rule (monthly) to both the
  template and the project's own HARNESS.md
- Command includes a validation checkpoint verifying all 10 sections
  are present and no placeholder markers remain
- Generated ONBOARDING.md is linked from the project README

Closes #37.

## 0.19.4 — 2026-04-15

### Output validation checkpoints

- Add validate-and-fix-in-place checkpoint to /harness-health —
  verifies all 12 snapshot sections present, no deprecated YAML block
- Add validation checkpoint to /assess — verifies assessment document
  has required sections and parseable level number for portfolio
  aggregation
- Add validation checkpoint to /reflect — verifies all 8 mandatory
  fields plus 4 session metadata subfields and Signal enum value
- Add validation checkpoint to /cost-capture — verifies cost snapshot
  has fields that /harness-health needs for Cost Indicators section
- Add validation checkpoint to /harness-constrain — verifies
  constraint block has required fields with valid enum values
- Add validation checkpoint to /harness-init — verifies generated
  HARNESS.md has all top-level sections, subsections, and template
  version marker
- Add validation checkpoint to /superpowers-init — verifies all 4
  habitat files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, MODEL_ROUTING.md,
  REFLECTION_LOG.md) have required sections

## 0.19.3 — 2026-04-15

### Governance Summary validation checkpoint

- Add step 5 to /governance-audit command: validate the Governance
  Summary section after the governance-auditor agent writes the report,
  fixing heading, field count, and value formats in place rather than
  re-dispatching the agent
- Strengthen governance-auditor agent instructions: mark the Governance
  Summary section as a critical format contract, add self-check
  instruction, explicitly forbid 0-based drift stage scale
- Fix existing governance audit report to use the correct
  `## Governance Summary` heading with all nine structured fields

## 0.19.2 — 2026-04-15

### Observatory signal completeness

- Add GC cadence compliance field to snapshot format — reports whether
  GC runs are within declared schedule, not just the last run date
- Add per-activity overdue annotations to Operational Cadence section —
  each activity now shows on-schedule/overdue status with target cadence
- Add `inactive` as third Learning flow state for projects with zero
  reflections, alongside existing `active` and `stalled`
- Add `Cadence compliance` and `Health` fields to Meta section template
  with full computation instructions — previously produced by agents
  but undocumented in the format spec
- Enforce `## Governance Summary` heading in governance-auditor output
  (was `## Summary`) — fixes regex parsing for Observatory consumers
- Require all nine Governance Summary fields to be present even when
  values are zero, with explicit computation instructions for each
- Enforce numeric `N/5` format for Semantic drift stage (was
  qualitative) and add `Frame alignment score` percentage computation

## 0.19.1 — 2026-04-15

### Markdownlint compliance

- Fix all 58 pre-existing markdownlint violations across articles, docs,
  commands, templates, and observability snapshots — MD036 (emphasis as
  heading), MD040 (code fence language), MD033 (inline HTML), MD001
  (heading increment), MD032 (blanks around lists), and others
- Upgrade HARNESS.md to template 0.19.0 with Observability section and
  governance constraint template; correct audit status counts and badge

### Version bump scoping

- Scope version bump requirement to `ai-literacy-superpowers/` plugin
  directory only — changes outside the plugin (articles, docs, CI,
  root config) no longer trigger the CI version bump check
- Add `no-bump` PR label exemption for formatting-only fixes to plugin
  files that don't warrant a version bump
- Update CLAUDE.md convention, HARNESS.md constraint, and
  version-check.yml workflow to reflect the scoped rules

## 0.19.0 — 2026-04-15

### Dev workflow — global plugin sync

- Add sync-to-global-cache.sh script and Stop hook in
  settings.local.json — syncs local plugin to the global Claude Code
  cache at session end so the installed version always reflects the
  working copy

### Harness template — Observability section

- Add `## Observability` section to HARNESS.md template with snapshot
  cadence, operating cadence, health thresholds, and regression
  detection configuration — new harnesses now include self-monitoring
  defaults out of the box

### Harness upgrade — adopt 0.18.1 template content

- Accept all new template items: 2 constraints (Tests must pass,
  Spec conformance), 4 active GC rules (Dependency currency,
  Observability archive, Convention file sync, Reflection-driven
  regression detection), and 7 commented-out GC rules (governance
  and fitness function templates)
- Update template-version marker to 0.19.0

## 0.18.1 — 2026-04-15

### Repo cleanup

- Remove 6 stale root-level directories (agents, commands, hooks,
  skills, scripts, templates) — all content already exists in the
  `ai-literacy-superpowers/` plugin directory
- Move template-currency-check.sh into plugin and wire up as
  SessionStart hook — completes the hook that 0.18.0 described
  but did not ship

## 0.18.0 — 2026-04-15

### Template adoption

- Add `/harness-upgrade` command — structural diff between user's
  HARNESS.md and plugin template, with accept/skip menu for new
  constraints, GC rules, sections, and optional blocks
- Add SessionStart hook for template currency — nudges user when
  plugin template has been updated since their harness was generated
- Add Template currency GC rule to template — weekly persistent
  reminder for un-reviewed template content
- Add `template-version` marker to generated HARNESS.md files for
  upgrade tracking
- Consolidate two diverged template files into single canonical copy
  at `ai-literacy-superpowers/templates/HARNESS.md`

## 0.17.1 — 2026-04-15

### Lint fix

- Fix markdownlint MD060 table separator spacing across 52 files —
  formatting only, no content changes

## 0.17.0 — 2026-04-15

### Release governance

- Add first governance constraint: release traceability — every
  plugin version must have a matching changelog heading and git tag
- Add auto-tag workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml`) that
  creates `vX.Y.Z` tags on merge when the version changes
- Add "Release tag completeness" GC rule with auto-fix for missing
  tags
- HARNESS.md Status: 12/12 constraints enforced, 3/8 GC rules active

## 0.16.0 — 2026-04-15

### Observatory rebase: YAML to markdown

- Remove `observatory_metrics` YAML block from snapshot format and
  generation — snapshots now contain only markdown sections that
  agents read natively
- Delete `observatory-metrics-schema.md` — schema versioning is no
  longer needed; format evolution is handled by Claude's natural
  ability to read markdown regardless of structural changes
- Delete `observatory-events.md` and stop appending to
  `observability/events.jsonl` — event tracking is replaced by the
  new "Changes Since Last Snapshot" markdown section in each snapshot
- Remove `observability/violations.jsonl` and all violation logging
  from CI workflows (`harness.yml`, `gc.yml`) and advisory hook — CI
  failure annotations and GC findings already capture this data
- Downgrade CI workflow permissions from `contents: write` to
  `contents: read` (no longer committing violations.jsonl)
- Replace governance YAML block in `governance-auditor` with a
  markdown Governance Summary section containing all expanded metrics
- Remove `observatory_portfolio` YAML block from portfolio assessment
  — habitat aggregates are now a markdown section reading snapshot
  markdown directly
- Add Regression Indicators section to snapshots — stale detection,
  cadence non-compliance counting, consecutive zero-reflection weeks,
  and composite regression flag
- Add Enforcement Loop History section to snapshots — tracks when
  advisory, strict, and investigative loops were first activated
  using git history
- Add Changes Since Last Snapshot section — captures constraint
  lifecycle (added, promoted, removed) and completed assessments and
  audits by diffing against the previous snapshot
- Add Habitat Aggregates section to portfolio assessment template
- Remove event emission instructions from `/reflect`,
  `/harness-constrain`, `/assess`, and governance-auditor commands
- Update governance-observability skill to use markdown format
  instead of YAML for metrics catalogue and snapshot extension

## 0.15.2 — 2026-04-14

### Bug fix

- Fix intermittent YAML block omission in harness-health snapshots —
  split Step 6 into separate markdown generation and YAML block steps
  with mandatory marker and self-verification checkpoint. The trailing
  instruction was unreliable under cognitive load from trend computation.

## 0.15.1 — 2026-04-14

### Bug fix

- Fix `gc-rotate.sh` crash when HARNESS.md has no `## Observability`
  section — `set -euo pipefail` caused the grep pipeline to exit
  non-zero before reaching the default cadence fallback. Added
  `|| true` to let empty results fall through. Fixes #122.

## Marketplace 0.2.1 — 2026-04-14

### GC findings fix

- Fix `marketplace.json` nested `plugins[0].version` stuck at "0.1.0" —
  updated to "0.15.0" to match `plugin.json`
- Align `plugins[0].description` with `plugin.json` description
- Bump marketplace listing version to 0.2.1

## 0.15.0 — 2026-04-14

### Observatory Tier 3: Violation Tracking, Portfolio Metrics, Event Log

- Add violation tracking via `observability/violations.jsonl` — advisory
  hook, CI constraint checks, and GC workflow now log detected violations
  as JSON Lines entries with timestamp, loop, constraint, and context
- Add violation latency metrics to snapshot YAML block —
  `feedback_loops.latency` with per-loop counts and `violations_total`
- Add `observatory_portfolio` YAML block to portfolio assessment reports
  with summary, level distribution, habitat aggregates (mean enforcement
  ratio, learning velocity, GC active ratio, context depth), gaps,
  outliers, and per-project detail
- Add Observatory event log at `observability/events.jsonl` — 10 event
  types tracking state transitions (snapshot creation, assessments,
  governance audits, constraint lifecycle, regression transitions,
  reflections, cadence configuration)
- Add event emission to `/harness-health`, `/reflect`,
  `/harness-constrain`, `/assess`, and `governance-auditor`
- Add `observatory-events.md` reference documenting event log format,
  event types, and emission matrix
- Bump Observatory metrics schema to 1.2.0 (backwards-compatible)

## 0.14.0 — 2026-04-14

### Observatory Tier 2: Regression Detection, Loop Tracking, Session Metadata

- Add `regression_indicators` section to Observatory YAML block —
  `snapshot_stale`, `cadence_non_compliant_count`,
  `consecutive_zero_reflection_weeks`, and composite `regression_flag`
- Expand `feedback_loops` with per-loop `active` and `first_activated`
  date fields, determined via git history lookups with caching
- Add session metadata to reflection entries — duration, model tiers
  used, pipeline stages completed, and agent delegation mode
  (best-effort, "unknown" always valid)
- Standardise governance audit YAML block with `schema_version`,
  `falsifiable_count`, `vague_count`, `drift_stage`, and
  `debt_total_score` fields
- Support configurable snapshot cadence via HARNESS.md Observability
  section — weekly (10d), fortnightly (21d), monthly (30d, default).
  Staleness check scripts and meta-observability checks now respect
  the configured threshold
- Bump Observatory metrics schema to 1.1.0 (backwards-compatible)

## 0.13.0 — 2026-04-14

### Observatory-Ready Metrics

- Add YAML metrics block to harness health snapshots — structured,
  typed `observatory_metrics` block appended after all markdown
  sections, enabling machine consumption without brittle regex parsing
- Add per-context-layer freshness tracking in `context_depth.layers` —
  each of the five context layers reports `present` and `last_modified`
- Add per-constraint enforcement detail in `constraint_maturity.constraints` —
  each constraint listed with name, tier, and enforced status
- Add observatory metrics schema documentation with versioning policy
  (patch/minor/major) and changelog at
  `references/observatory-metrics-schema.md`

## 0.12.0 — 2026-04-13

### Governance Dimension Support

- Add `governance-auditor` agent for deep governance investigation —
  semantic drift analysis, governance debt inventory, constraint
  falsifiability scoring, three-frame alignment checks

  freshness, semantic drift early warning, governance debt cycle check
- Extend HARNESS.md template with governance constraint example and
  governance GC rules

## 0.11.0 — 2026-04-12

### Spec-First Discipline Gate

- Add spec-first commit ordering CI workflow — deterministic gate that
  verifies the first commit on feature branches contains only a spec
  file, with exemptions for bug-fix and maintenance PRs
- Add "Spec-first commit ordering" constraint to HARNESS.md —
  deterministic enforcement via the new CI workflow
- Add "Spec captures intent" constraint to HARNESS.md — agent review
  checking that specs describe problem, approach, and expected outcome
- Extend harness-enforcer agent with spec intent review guidance

## 0.10.0 — 2026-04-11

### Independent Marketplace Listing Versioning

- Add `plugin_version` field to `marketplace.json` — the listing now
  explicitly declares which plugin release it approves
- Add marketplace versioning convention to CLAUDE.md — agents know
  when to bump listing version vs update plugin pointer
- Add marketplace plugin version sync constraint to HARNESS.md —
  CI blocks PRs where `plugin_version` diverges from `plugin.json`

  projects get one-concern-per-PR enforcement by default
- Add change cadence drift GC rule to template HARNESS.md — weekly
  monitoring of PR size distribution and cycle time
- Add Human Pace observable evidence signals to assessment skill at
  L2 (TDD-paced diffs), L3 (spec-scoped constraint, cadence drift GC),
  L4 (spec-to-PR mapping), and L5 (cadence metrics as health signal)

## 0.9.2 — 2026-04-10

### Bug Fix

- Fix curation-nudge Stop hook arithmetic error — `grep -c` outputs 0
  to stdout before exiting non-zero under `set -e`, causing the
  `|| echo "0"` fallback to produce `"0\n0"` which breaks arithmetic.
  Fixed both `reflection_count` (line 27) and `promoted_count` (line 42)
  to use `|| var=0` pattern instead.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-04-10

### Article 08: The Loops That Learn

- Add Article 08 — how four recurring practices (/reflect,
  /harness-health, /assess, /cost-capture) create interlocking
  feedback loops at four timescales, connect to the six literacy
  levels, and aggregate into the portfolio view

## 0.9.0 — 2026-04-10

- Add "Track AI Costs" how-to guide
- Closes the cost visibility gap identified in the L5 assessment

## 0.8.3 — 2026-04-10

### Reflection-Driven Improvements

- Add how-to template file (`docs/how-to/_template.md`) — explicit
  structure for subagents writing how-to guides, removing style
  inference from examples
- Add CI version consistency check (`version-check.yml`) — verifies
  plugin.json, README badge, and CHANGELOG heading all match, and
  that skill/agent/command changes trigger a version bump
- Add version consistency constraint to HARNESS.md (7/7 enforced)

## 0.8.2 — 2026-04-09

  documents with AI literacy portfolio assessment data
- Template mode generates a full Team API with AI Literacy section,
  communication preferences, services, dependencies, and ways of
  working
- Update mode adds or refreshes the AI Literacy section in an existing
  Team API document, preserving all other sections
- Includes Team API template in references/team-api-template.md

## 0.7.1 — 2026-04-09

  /harness-init (after commit) and /assess (at L3+)
- Add Agent Harness Enabled badge (black) to README
- Tag signals to portfolio assessments that a repo has a harness

## 0.7.0 — 2026-04-09

### Portfolio Dashboard Skill

- Add portfolio-dashboard skill — generates a self-contained HTML
  dashboard from portfolio assessment data with level distribution,
  repo table, shared gaps, improvement plan, and trend visualisation
  from multiple quarterly assessments
- Dashboard is single HTML file with inline CSS, no external
  dependencies, works offline, shareable via email or Slack

## 0.6.1 — 2026-04-09

### Documentation

  across multiple repos into an organisational portfolio view with
  level distribution, shared gaps, outliers, and improvement plans
- Three discovery modes: local directories, GitHub org, GitHub topic
  tags — combinable for flexible portfolio scoping
- Lightweight evidence-only scan for repos without prior assessments —
  estimates level from observable signals via GitHub API without
  running a full assessment
- Portfolio improvement plan groups actions by impact scope:
  organisation-wide (50%+ repos), cluster (2-4 repos), individual
- Add /portfolio-assess command with --local, --org, --topic, and
  --no-scan-unassessed flags

## 0.5.0 — 2026-04-09

### Literacy Improvements Skill

  plans from assessment gaps, mapping each gap to the specific plugin
  command or skill that closes it
- Includes improvement-mapping reference with level-to-action tables
  for L1→L2, L2→L3, L3→L4, and L4→L5 transitions
- Users choose a target level (next level or higher) and walk through
  improvements interactively with accept/skip/defer

## 0.4.0 — 2026-04-08

### Article Updates

- Update Article 06 (The Learning Loop) with signal classification
  taxonomy and Feedback Flywheel citation — reflections now classify
  their signal type to route learnings during curation

### Model Sovereignty Skill

- Add model-sovereignty skill to the plugin — decision framework for
  model selection, hosting, fine-tuning, and vendor independence with
  three reference files (decision framework, hosting options, technique
  comparison)

### README Component Counts

- Update skills badge and section from 14 to 18 — add secrets-detection,
  auto-enforcer-action, convention-sync, and fitness-functions to the
  skills table
- Update commands badge and section from 12 to 13 — add /convention-sync
  to the commands table

### Feedback Flywheel Integration

- Add signal classification to reflections — each reflection now
  captures a signal type (context, instruction, workflow, failure, none)
  that routes the learning to the right harness component during curation,
  adopting the taxonomy from Birgitta Boeckeler's Feedback Flywheel article
- Add vocabulary mapping section to compound learning docs — maps plugin
  concepts to the Feedback Flywheel article's terminology with direct
  citation and links
- Add Feedback Flywheel article to further reading in compound learning
  and self-improving harness explanation pages
- Add Session Quality section to health snapshot format — tracks signal
  classification metrics (reflections with signal percentage, distribution
  by type, quality trend) derived from the new Signal field
- Update /harness-health command to gather and display Session Quality
  metrics in snapshots and delta summaries

### Organisation Transfer

- Update all references from russmiles to Habitat-Thinking after
  GitHub repo transfer — README badges, docs site config, install
  commands, and getting-started tutorial

### Documentation Fixes

- Fix docs homepage Quick Install section to use the correct two-step
  marketplace install commands matching the getting-started tutorial

### Three-Loop Improvements

- Add markdownlint to CI workflow — closes gap between declared and
  enforced constraints, bringing inner loop enforcement to 100%
- Create AGENTS.md with initial curated entries from REFLECTION_LOG —
  unblocks the compound learning promotion lifecycle
- Add weekly GC GitHub Action running deterministic GC rules (secret
  scanner operational, snapshot staleness, shell syntax, strict mode)
- Add rotating GC Stop hook that checks one rule per session by
  day-of-year rotation — catches entropy between weekly CI runs
- Add curation nudge Stop hook that detects unpromoted reflections
  and nudges curation into AGENTS.md
- Add markdownlint PreToolUse command hook for deterministic .md file
  checking alongside the existing prompt-based constraint evaluation
- Update HARNESS.md status: 6/6 constraints enforced, 2/5 GC active
- Generate health snapshot with trend comparison

### Documentation Alignment

- Update README badges (6/6 enforced, snapshot link to 2026-04-08),
  hook count (5→8), hook list, and mechanism map to reflect new hooks
  and GC execution mechanisms
- Update three-enforcement-loops explanation page: inner loop now
  describes 2 PreToolUse hooks and 7 Stop scripts
- Add "How GC Rules Are Triggered" section to garbage-collection
  explanation page covering weekly CI, rotating Stop hook, and manual
  invocation
- Populate hooks reference page (was "Coming Soon" stub) with full
  catalogue of all 8 hooks including design principles

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-07

### Selective Harness Init

- Enhance /harness-init with feature selection menu — users choose which
  harness features to configure (context, constraints, GC, CI,
  observability) with all selected by default
- Support additive re-runs — existing configuration is preserved when
  adding new features incrementally
- Gate each conversational step on feature selection so users only
  answer questions for features they chose
- Update Getting Started tutorial with feature selection walkthrough,
  re-run guidance, and per-feature generation notes
- Update homepage with selective init description
- Update harness engineering explanation with incremental adoption paragraph

### Habitat Engineering Documentation

- Add habitat engineering explanation page covering the intellectual
  lineage (Alexander, Gabriel, Knuth, Terhorst-North), the central
  insight that AI failures are environment problems, habitat vs harness
  distinction, the six levels of AI literacy, and links to Software
  Enchiridion articles

### GitHub Pages Build Fix

- Fix Jekyll build by changing color_scheme from "default" to "light" —
  just-the-docs v0.12.0 renamed the default color scheme file from
  default.scss to light.scss, causing "Can't find stylesheet to import"

### Documentation Site

- Add GitHub Pages documentation site using Jekyll + just-the-docs theme
- Organize content using the Diataxis framework (tutorials, how-to,
  reference, explanation)
- Full pages: Getting Started tutorial, Set Up Secret Detection how-to,
  Skills reference catalogue, Harness Engineering explanation
- Stub pages for 17 additional topics ready for future content

### Auto-Constraint from Reflections

- Add auto-constraint proposal step to `/reflect` command — after
  capturing a reflection, the command now detects preventable failures
  in the Surprise and Improvement fields and offers to draft a
  constraint via `/harness-constrain`
- Add optional Constraint field to REFLECTION_LOG.md template — makes
  constraint proposals machine-readable for the regression suite GC rule

### Learnings in Agent Context

- Update orchestrator agent to read the 20 most recent REFLECTION_LOG.md
  entries at pipeline start — past reflections now inform approach decisions
- Update harness-enforcer agent to read the 10 most recent reflections
  before agent-based constraint checks — calibrates scrutiny to known gaps
- Update harness-gc agent to read the 10 most recent reflections when
  running GC rules — entropy signals from reflections guide deeper checks
- Add Learnings section to CLAUDE.md template advising agents to consult
  REFLECTION_LOG.md before starting work

### Regression Suite GC Rule

- Add reflection-driven regression detection GC rule to HARNESS.md
  template — weekly agent check that mines REFLECTION_LOG.md for
  recurring failure patterns not yet covered by constraints
- Add learning-driven GC category to the GC skill and catalogue —
  a new class of GC rules that use compound learning artifacts
  (reflections, assessments) as input rather than scanning code

### Self-Improving Harness (from auto-harness research)

- Add design spec for auto-constraint generation from reflections —
  closes the learning loop by offering to create constraints when
  reflections describe preventable failures
- Add design spec for regression suite GC rule — mines
  REFLECTION_LOG.md for recurring failure patterns and proposes
  constraints for uncovered themes
- Add design spec for feeding learnings into agent context —
  orchestrator, enforcer, and GC agents read recent reflections
  to avoid repeating past mistakes

### Complexity Hotspot Detection

- Expand fitness-functions skill with practical hotspot detection
  guide — churn extraction command, per-ecosystem complexity tools,
  worked Python example, and 3-snapshot threshold rule
- Expand fitness catalogue with complete bash script for churn x
  complexity correlation, annotated example output, and ecosystem
  prerequisites

### Executable Spec Integration

- Add executable spec constraint pattern to constraint-design skill —
  documents how to wire test suites into the harness as a spec
  conformance constraint, including the deterministic + agent
  enforcement pattern and BDD/Cucumber as gold standard
- Add commented-out spec conformance constraint to HARNESS.md template
  for projects using spec-first development

### Dependency Age Budget (libyear)

- Add dependency age (libyear) section to the dependency-vulnerability-audit
  skill — covers what libyear measures, commands per ecosystem (npm, Ruby,
  Python, Go), recommended thresholds, and how to read the output
- Add dependency age budget GC rule to HARNESS.md template as a commented-out
  fitness function for weekly deterministic checking

### Tier 2 Design Proposals

- Add design proposal for complexity hotspot detection — weekly GC rule
  correlating git churn with cognitive complexity to find decay hotspots
- Add design proposal for dependency age budget (libyear) — aggregate
  staleness metric complementing CVE scanning
- Add design proposal for executable spec integration — making specs
  load-bearing by wiring test suites into the constraint system

### Workflow and Conventions

- Add CHANGELOG convention to CLAUDE.md — changelog updates required
  before every PR
- Broaden Bash permission patterns in `.claude/settings.local.json`
  for reliable parallel worktree agent execution

### Tier 1 Feature: Auto-Enforcer GitHub Action

- Add `auto-enforcer-action` skill for setting up automatic PR constraint
  checking via GitHub Actions
- Add `ci-auto-enforcer.yml` CI template — reads HARNESS.md at runtime,
  runs deterministic constraints (blocking) and agent constraints
  (advisory PR comments) on every pull request
- Update `harness-init` to offer auto-enforcer setup when agent PR
  constraints exist

### Tier 1 Feature: Convention Sync Across AI Tools

- Add `convention-sync` skill — reads HARNESS.md and generates convention
  files for Cursor (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), Copilot
  (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`), and Windsurf (`.windsurf/rules/`)
- Add `/convention-sync` slash command for direct invocation
- Add "Convention file sync" GC rule to HARNESS.md template for weekly
  drift detection

### Tier 1 Feature: Architectural Fitness Functions

- Add `fitness-functions` skill with catalogue of periodic architectural
  checks (structural, coupling, complexity/hotspot, coverage)
- Add reference catalogue with concrete HARNESS.md GC rule entries and
  tool commands per language ecosystem
- Add fitness functions as sixth category in the GC skill and catalogue
- Add commented-out fitness function examples to HARNESS.md template

### Compound Learning

- Capture reflections on Tier 1 research and parallel implementation
- Diagnose worktree agent permission issue — root cause was user
  permission denials during parallel prompt chaos, not worktree
  isolation itself

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-06

### Secrets Detection

- Add `secrets-detection` skill for gitleaks-based secret scanning —
  covers installation, scanning, baselining, configuration, CI
  integration, and remediation
- Promote "No secrets in source" constraint to deterministic with
  gitleaks in the HARNESS.md template
- Add `secrets-check.sh` Stop-scope hook script for advisory gitleaks
  scanning at session end
- Wire hook into `hooks.json` and add gitleaks discovery to
  `/harness-init` constraint setup
- Add "Secret scanner operational" GC rule

### Project Harness Initialization

- Initialize HARNESS.md for the plugin itself with 6 constraints and
  5 GC rules
- Add `.github/workflows/harness.yml` CI workflow enforcing gitleaks,
  bash syntax, strict mode, and ShellCheck on every PR
- Fix ShellCheck warnings in `secrets-check.sh`,
  `snapshot-staleness-check.sh`, and `update-health-badge.sh`
- Promote ShellCheck constraint from unverified to deterministic
  (5/6 constraints enforced)
- Add harness enforcement and health badges to README

### Compound Learning

- Initialize REFLECTION_LOG.md with first session reflections
- Generate baseline harness health snapshot

### Plugin Structure

- Move plugin into `ai-literacy-superpowers/` subdirectory for
  marketplace install compatibility
