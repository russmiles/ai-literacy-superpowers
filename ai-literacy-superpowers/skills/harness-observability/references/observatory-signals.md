# Observatory Signal Checklist

The authoritative list of all data signals the Habitat Observatory
expects to read from projects running ai-literacy-superpowers. The
`/observatory-verify` command reads this file to determine what to
check.

Update this checklist when new signals are added to format specs
or when the Observatory's expectations change.
