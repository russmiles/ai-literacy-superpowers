# /harness-init

Set up a living harness for this project. This is the guided on-ramp
that produces a working HARNESS.md from a conversation.

Read the `harness-engineering` and `context-engineering` skills from
this plugin before proceeding. They provide the conceptual framework
and convention-writing guidance needed for this conversation.

## Process

### 1. Discover

Dispatch the `harness-discoverer` agent to scan the project. Wait for
its discovery report before proceeding.

### 2. Present Findings

Show the user what was discovered:

- Tech stack and versions
- Existing linters, formatters, and CI checks
- Any existing convention documentation (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Pre-commit hooks already in place

Frame this as: "Here's what your project already has. Let's build on
it."

### 3. Select Features

Present a feature selection menu. The five selectable areas are:

| Feature | What it configures | Default (first run) |
|---|---|---|
| Context engineering | Stack declaration + conventions | on |
| Architectural constraints | Enforcement rules + secret detection | on |
| Garbage collection | Periodic entropy checks | on |
| CI configuration | GitHub Actions workflow + auto-enforcer | on |
| Observability | README badge + status section | on |

**First run** (no HARNESS.md exists): all features default to on.

**Re-run** (HARNESS.md exists): detect which sections are already
configured by checking for the placeholder marker
`<!-- Not yet configured. Run /harness-init and select this feature to set up. -->`
in each section. Already-configured sections default to off (skip).
Unconfigured sections default to on. The user can toggle any combination.

Tell the user: "All features are selected by default. Deselect any you
want to skip for now — you can always add them later by re-running
/harness-init."

On re-run, tell the user which features are already configured and
frame unconfigured features as recommendations: "These features aren't
set up yet. I recommend adding them."

### 4. Ask About Conventions

**Gate**: only run this step if "Context engineering" was selected in
step 3. If not selected, skip to the next step silently.

Ask the user about their conventions, one topic at a time. Use the
discovery report to make informed suggestions. Cover:

- **Naming**: What casing and patterns does the team use?
- **File structure**: How are files organised? One type per file?
- **Error handling**: How should errors be handled and propagated?
- **Documentation**: What must have doc comments? What should comments
  explain?

For each topic, offer concrete options based on what the discoverer
found. Use the convention patterns from the `context-engineering` skill
to ensure conventions are enforceable.

### 5. Ask About Constraints

**Gate**: only run this step if "Architectural constraints" was selected
in step 3. If not selected, skip to the next step silently.

For each convention, ask whether the user wants it enforced. For each
that should be enforced:

- Check if a deterministic tool was discovered that could enforce it
- If yes, offer to configure it and set enforcement to `deterministic`
- If no, offer agent-based enforcement or leave as `unverified`

Ask about scope: should this check run at commit time (fast feedback),
PR time (strict gate), or weekly (periodic sweep)?

#### Secret detection (default constraint)

The template includes a "No secrets in source" constraint. During setup:

1. Check whether `gitleaks` is available: `command -v gitleaks`
2. If **found**: inform the user that the constraint will be set to
   `deterministic` with gitleaks as the tool. Ask if they want to
   customise the configuration (e.g. add allowlist paths). Offer to
   run an initial scan: `gitleaks detect --source . --no-banner`
3. If **not found**: inform the user that the constraint will remain
   `unverified`. Suggest installation:
   - macOS: `brew install gitleaks`
   - Linux/Go: `go install github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/v8@latest`
   - Then re-run `/harness-init` or use `/harness-constrain` to promote

Either way, tell the user what happened and allow them to override.
Read the `secrets-detection` skill from this plugin for full gitleaks
guidance if the user asks questions about configuration or scanning.

### 6. Ask About Garbage Collection

**Gate**: only run this step if "Garbage collection" was selected in
step 3. If not selected, skip to the next step silently.

Ask whether the user wants periodic checks for:

- Documentation freshness
- Dependency currency
- Convention drift
- Dead code

For each, set frequency and auto-fix preference.

### 7. Generate HARNESS.md

**First run** (no HARNESS.md exists):

Read the template from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/HARNESS.md`.
For each selected feature, replace placeholder values with discovered
facts and user responses as before. For each unselected feature, replace
the section body with the placeholder marker:

```
<!-- Not yet configured. Run /harness-init and select this feature to set up. -->
```

Write the result to `HARNESS.md` at the project root.

**Re-run** (HARNESS.md exists):

Read the existing `HARNESS.md`. For each selected feature, replace the
corresponding section (`## Context`, `## Constraints`,
`## Garbage Collection`, or `## Status`) with freshly generated content
from user responses. For unselected features, preserve the existing
section content verbatim — do not modify it.

Section boundaries are defined by the `##` headings in the template:
`## Context`, `## Constraints`, `## Garbage Collection`, `## Status`.
Each section runs from its `##` heading to the next `##` heading or
end of file.

### 8. Generate CI Configuration

**Gate**: only run this step if "CI configuration" was selected in
step 3.

**Dependency**: CI configuration requires constraints to exist. If
"Architectural constraints" was not selected in step 3 and no
`## Constraints` section exists in HARNESS.md (or it contains only the
placeholder marker), tell the user: "CI configuration requires at least
one constraint to enforce. Skipping CI setup — run /harness-init again
after adding constraints." Then skip to the next step.

If constraints exist (either just configured or from a previous run),
proceed with the existing CI generation logic:

If GitHub Actions was detected (or the user confirms it), read the
template from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/ci-github-actions.yml`.
Add deterministic tool steps for each PR-scoped deterministic
constraint. Write to `.github/workflows/harness.yml`.

If no CI was detected, offer the generic script from
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/ci-generic.sh`.

#### Auto-enforcer for agent PR constraints

After generating `harness.yml`, check whether the HARNESS.md being
produced contains any agent-scoped PR constraints. If it does:

1. Inform the user: "Your harness includes agent-based PR constraints.
   These cannot run in the standard CI workflow — they require the
   auto-enforcer action."
2. Offer to copy `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/ci-auto-enforcer.yml`
   to `.github/workflows/auto-enforcer.yml` as part of the init commit
3. Remind the user to add the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret to their
   repository before the first PR: Settings > Secrets and variables >
   Actions > New repository secret
4. Read the `auto-enforcer-action` skill from this plugin for full
   setup guidance if the user asks questions

If no agent PR constraints exist, skip this offer silently.

### 9. Add README Badge

**Gate**: only run this step if "Observability" was selected in step 3.

**Dependency**: the badge requires HARNESS.md to exist with at least
one configured section. If HARNESS.md contains only placeholder markers
(no real content was generated), tell the user: "No harness features
configured yet — skipping badge. Run /harness-init to add features
first." Then skip to the next step.

If HARNESS.md has content, proceed with badge generation as before:

Add the harness badge to the project's README.md. Use the badge update
script at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update-badge.sh` or insert
manually:

```text
[![Harness](https://img.shields.io/badge/Harness-0%2FN_enforced-808080?style=flat-square)](HARNESS.md)
```

### 10. Commit

Stage and commit all generated files:

- HARNESS.md
- CI workflow (if generated)
- README.md (badge update)

Commit message: "Initialize project harness with HARNESS.md"

### 11. Summary

Tell the user:

- How many constraints were declared and how many are enforced
- What to do next: `/harness-constrain` to add more rules,
  `/harness-status` to check health, `/harness-audit` to verify
  enforcement
