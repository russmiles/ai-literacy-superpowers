# /cost-capture

Capture a cost snapshot for this project's AI tool usage.

Read the `cost-tracking` skill before proceeding — it contains the
snapshot format, provider dashboard URLs, and the comparison logic.

## Process

### 1. Find Previous Snapshot

Check for existing cost snapshots:

```bash
ls observability/costs/*-costs.md 2>/dev/null | sort | tail -1
```

If a previous snapshot exists, read it for comparison. If none exist,
this is the first capture.

### 2. Ask About Providers

```text
Which AI providers are you using?

1. Anthropic only
2. OpenAI only
3. Both Anthropic and OpenAI
4. Other (specify)
```

### 3. Guide to Dashboard

For each provider, give the dashboard URL and tell the user what to
look for:

- Monthly spend for the reporting period
- Token usage (input and output) if available
- Model-level breakdown if available

Ask the user to read off the numbers. One provider at a time.

### 4. Record Model Breakdown

If the user can see per-model data:

```text
Can you see a breakdown by model? If so, list each model with
its token usage or cost.
```

If not available, skip this section.

### 5. Estimate Project Share

If the user has multiple projects on the same account:

```text
Roughly what percentage of the total spend is this project?
An estimate is fine — we're looking for order of magnitude,
not precision.
```

### 6. Compare to Previous

If a previous snapshot exists, compute and present:

- Spend change ($ and %)
- Token volume change
- Model mix changes
- Any concerning trends

### 7. Budget Check

```text
Do you have a monthly budget for AI tools?

1. Yes — what is it?
2. No — would you like to set one based on current spend?
3. Not applicable
```

If spend exceeds budget, flag it.

### 8. Update MODEL_ROUTING.md

If the cost data suggests routing changes (e.g. heavy frontier use
for tasks that could use standard models), propose updates to
MODEL_ROUTING.md. Present each change and ask for approval.

### 9. Write the Snapshot

Create `observability/costs/YYYY-MM-DD-costs.md` using the format
from the cost-tracking skill.

### 10. Validate Cost Snapshot

**This step is mandatory.** After writing the cost snapshot, read
`observability/costs/YYYY-MM-DD-costs.md` and verify it contains the
fields that `/harness-health` needs to parse for the Cost Indicators
section.

**Structural checks:**

1. File exists at the expected path
2. Period field present (date range for the snapshot)
3. Total spend field present (even if estimated)
4. Model routing reference present (whether MODEL_ROUTING.md was
   updated)

Reference the `cost-tracking` skill for the full field definitions.

If any check fails, fix the snapshot in place:

- Add missing fields with "not tracked" as the value

Do not re-run the capture conversation. Fix the output directly.

### 11. Commit

```bash
mkdir -p observability/costs
git add observability/costs/ MODEL_ROUTING.md
git commit -m "Cost snapshot: YYYY-MM-DD"
```

### 12. Summary

```text
Cost snapshot captured: observability/costs/YYYY-MM-DD-costs.md

  Period: YYYY-MM to YYYY-MM
  Total spend: $X,XXX
  Monthly average: $X,XXX
  Trend: [increasing/stable/decreasing vs previous]
  Budget status: [within/over/not set]
  MODEL_ROUTING.md: [updated/unchanged]
```
