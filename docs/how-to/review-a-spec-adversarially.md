# Review a Spec Adversarially

Run `/diaboli` to get an adversarial review of a spec (before plan approval) or an
implementation (before integration). The same command, same agent, same output format —
only the category weighting and output path differ by mode.

## When to use this

**Spec mode (default):**

- After `/spec-writer` completes and before you approve the plan
- When a spec is substantially edited after an objection record already exists
  (the command regenerates the record; prior dispositions are lost — this is intentional)
- When working outside the full orchestrator pipeline and you want adversarial review on demand

**Code mode (`--mode code`):**

- After the final code-reviewer PASS (or MAX_REVIEW_CYCLES escalation), before integration-agent
- When working outside the orchestrator pipeline and you want adversarial review of the implementation

Do not use this as a quality check on your own reasoning. The point of the agent is that it
disagrees with you from a clean context. Running it after you have already decided to proceed
removes the gate it is meant to enforce.

## 1. Run `/diaboli <spec-path> [--mode spec|code]`

Pass the path to the spec file and an optional mode flag:

```text
# Spec mode (default — before plan approval)
/diaboli docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-my-feature.md

# Code mode (after final code-reviewer PASS, before integration)
/diaboli docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-my-feature.md --mode code
```

The slug is derived from the spec filename by stripping the date prefix and `.md` extension.
For example, `2026-04-19-my-feature.md` → `my-feature`.

Output paths:
- Spec mode: `docs/superpowers/objections/my-feature.md`
- Code mode: `docs/superpowers/objections/my-feature-code.md`

## 2. Read the objection record

The record has two parts:

**YAML frontmatter** — a machine-readable list of objections, each with:

- `id` — O1, O2, … in order of severity
- `category` — one of: `premise`, `scope`, `implementation`, `risk`, `alternatives`,
  `specification quality`
- `severity` — one of: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`
- `claim` — one sentence stating the objection
- `evidence` — a quote or citation from the spec that grounds the objection
- `disposition` — starts as `pending`; you fill this in
- `disposition_rationale` — starts as `null`; you write this

**Prose body** — one `## O<N>` section per objection with the claim restated, the
evidence expanded, and an explanation of why the objection matters if unaddressed.

Read the prose sections, not just the frontmatter. The prose is where the reasoning lives.

---

## 3. Write dispositions inline

Open the objection record and fill in `disposition` and `disposition_rationale` for each
objection in the YAML frontmatter.

Valid disposition values:

- `accepted` — the objection is valid; the spec or approach will change
- `rejected` — the objection is not valid; the rationale must explain why
- `deferred` — acknowledged; the concern is real but will be addressed separately
- `fix` — shorthand for accepted with a planned correction (same weight as `accepted`)
- `leave` — shorthand for rejected with a deliberate choice to keep the current approach

**This step cannot be delegated back to an agent.** The agent's trust boundary is
read-only — it cannot write dispositions. This is structural: a human must engage
with the objections and write a rationale before the pipeline proceeds. That engagement
is the mechanism. If you find yourself wanting to have an agent fill in the dispositions,
the gate is not working.

For `critical` and `high` severity objections, the rationale must be substantive. "Looks
fine" is not a rationale. "This will be addressed by X change to the spec" is.

---

## 4. Update the spec if needed

If objections are `accepted` or `fix`, update the spec to reflect what changes. The
objection record stays as written — it is a permanent record of the adversarial review
at a point in time.

If the spec changes substantially (new approach, different scope, different artefact
list), re-run `/diaboli` on the updated spec. The old record will be overwritten; old
dispositions are not preserved. This is intentional: a substantially revised spec is a
new thing and deserves a fresh adversarial review.

---

## 5. What you have now

An adjudicated objection record with all dispositions filled and all rationales written.

- **Spec mode**: the plan-approval gate will not advance while any disposition is `pending`.
  The record lives at `docs/superpowers/objections/<slug>.md`.
- **Code mode**: the integration-approval gate will not advance while any disposition is
  `pending`. The record lives at `docs/superpowers/objections/<slug>-code.md`.

A GC rule checks weekly whether specs or implementations have been modified more recently
than their corresponding records — if so, the record is flagged as stale.

As records accumulate, disposition patterns (distribution, mean objections per record,
split by mode) become visible in `/superpowers-status` Section 7 and the harness-health
snapshot Diaboli panel. These surfaces update on the normal health cadence without
requiring a separate command. Cross-mode patterns (spec-time vs code-time objection rates)
carry interpretive signal about whether the spec-time charter is catching issues early.

## Next steps

- **Spec mode**: once all dispositions are filled, return to the orchestrator pipeline and
  present the plan for approval; proceed to tdd-agent only after plan approval
- **Code mode**: once all dispositions are filled, proceed to integration-agent
- See [Adversarial Review]({% link explanation/adversarial-review.md %}) for the
  conceptual background on why this gate exists and what the agent is not allowed to do
